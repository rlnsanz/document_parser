    "value": "Chapter 1 \u2022 Real Estate Law and Real Estate Business\n\u2022 Congress passes laws that are binding in al states (for example, Federal Fair Housing\nLaws).\n\u2022 The federal burcaucracy is comprised of departments, boards, and commissions.\nThe Code of Federal Regulations contains the administrative rules developed by\nfederal administrative agencies to implement federal statutes. For example, the\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers laws and\nannounces federal regulations. HUD is an agency that developed administrative rules\nto implement the Federal Fair Housing Amendment Acts of 1988.\n\u2022 The state constitution establishes the limits of govemmental power within the state.\nOne example is Article XXVI of the Arizona Constitution, which gives licensees the\nauthority to prepare documents related to real estate transactions.\n\u2022 The state legislature enacts bills (also known as statutes), which become law when\nsigned by the governor. Title 32 of the Arizona Revised Statutes (ARS) includes the\nset of statutes that established the Arizona Department of Real Estate and real estate\nlicensing law and governs real estate transactions and licensees in Arizona.\nestate and real estate licensees.\n\u2022 Local govemments have the power to adopt laws affecting the city or town. Local\ngovemment laws are known as ordinances.\nCommon Law\nCommon law is based on tradition, customs, and usage and is generally unwritten in\nstatute or code. Common law was developed in England and transferred to the United\nStates with the early colonists.\nCommon law is also derived from judicial decisions. Court decisions interpret stat-\nutory law and set precedents with the same force as law. Only the published decision of\nan appellate court (that is, the Arizona Court of Appeals or the Arizona Supreme Court)\nestablishes a legal precedent; trial court decisions, while important to the litigants\ninvolved in that case, do not establish a legal precedent.\nCommon law is the basis for the legal system throughout the United States, with the\nexception of Louisiana. In Arizona, common law has the same effect as statutory law,\nunless a statute has been passed to the contrary.\nTHE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS\nMany people think of the real estate profession solely as the business of buying and sell-\ning property, including the representation of the buyer or seller by a real estate agent or\nbroker. While this is the major business of real estate professionals, there are many other\nareas of specialization within the business and numerous other businesses or professions\nthat specialize in real estate. Some of the major divisions of the real estate business are\ndescribed in the following section.\nBrokerages\nA brokerage is the business of bringing buyers and sellers together in the marketplace\nfor a fee called a commission. Brokerages may specialize in residential (new homes or\nresale homes), commercial, industrial, or farm and agricultural properties; property man-\nagement; leasing; or exchanging. In practice, most brokerages specialize in only two or\nthree of these categories, although nothing restricts a brokerage from being involved in\nany or all categories.\nChapter 1 \u2022 Real Estate Law and Real Estate Business\nProperty Development\nProperty development includes subdividers who take raw land, do the initial planning\nfor its best use by subdividing it into lots, and, after approval of the plan by the proper\nauthorities, do the initial development of the streets, sewers, sidewalks, and so on.\nLand developers improve lots by adding buildings and then sell the developed lots\nthemselves or have a brokerage handle sales. Architects and builders who work for the\nland developer do the planning and construction of homes or other buildings designed\nfor the use of the subdivided lots. Very often the subdivider and the developer are the\ns a m e person.\nProperty Management\nProperty management is a rapidly growing area of the real estate business, due to\nincreased construction of urban-area large apartment complexes, condominiums, coop-\neratives, commercial buildings, and industrial parks. All of these income properties re-\nquire special management i n order t o provide the best yield t o the investor.\nConsequently, many brokerages either focus exclusively on property management or\nforn a separate property management division.\nAppraising\nIn almost all real estate transactions, an opinion of property value must be estab-\nlished. For this reason, appraising is an important division of the real estate busi-\nness. Appraisals are necessary for many purposes, including determining insurance\nvalue, assessed value, condemnation value, and so on. Appraisers may either be\nstaff appraisers working for county assessors, banks, or the government, or they\nmay work as independent fee appraisers.\nOther Real Estate Businesses and Professions\nIn addition to brokers, subdividers, developers, property managers, and appraisers, the\nbusiness of real estate relies on the services of several other business sectors and profes-\nsionals, a s outlined below.\n\u2022 Business brokers are brokers who sell businesses. Generally, business brokers are\nrequired to have a real estate license.\n\u2022 Financing and investment service \ufb01rms include banks, savings and loans, individual\ninvestors, pension funds, and insurance companies.\n\u2022 Mortgage brokers and mortgage banking provide \ufb01nancing and loan processing, and\npackage and service loans for investors.\ngovemment.\n\u2022 Government divisions, such as the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Services, and\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, affect the business of real estate.\n\u2022 Escrow services ful\ufb01ll escrow instructions and handle closings.\n\u2022 Title companies complete title analysis and issue title insurance.\nIn addition, one or more of the foregoing professions may require additional education\nand/or testing. For example, an Arizona business broker must have a real estate license,\nattend additional classes, and pass an additional test relating to the sale of businesses. All\nof the above businesses and professions will be discussed in later chapters.\n",

This includes buying, sell-\ning, exchanging, leasing, or renting real property for others for a commission.\nA licensed real estate broker, who is also referred to as a designated broker, operates\neach brokerage. A designated broker is de\ufb01ned in the Arizona statutes as a licensed\nbroker who is either\na. Designated to act on behalf of an employing real estate entity, or\nb. Doing business as a sole proprietor.\nIn addition to being formed as a sole proprietorship, a brokerage can be organized as\na partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation. The designated broker\nfor an entity licensee may be a natural person who is quali\ufb01ed to act as a real estate bro-\nker, but a designated broker for an entity licensee could also be one of two (and only\ntwo) types of business entities: a professional corporation or a professional limited lia-\nbility company. A natural person is a live person, not a corporation or LLC. Other\nrequirements to serve as the designated broker for an entity depend on the brokerage en-\ntity type as follows:\n\u2022 Parinership licensee is a partnership with a managing general partner who is licensed\nas the designated broker.\n\u2022 Corporation licensee is a lawfully organized corporation that is registered with the\nArizona Corporation Commission and that has an of\ufb01cer licensed as the designated\nbroker.\n\u2022 Limited Liability Company licensee is a lawfully organized limited liability company\nthat has a member or manager licensed as the designated broker.\nThere may be more than one licensed broker in a brokerage but only one designated broker.\nOther brokers who hold licenses with a brokerage \ufb01nn would do so as associate brokers.\nAssociate brokers have the same privileges and responsibilities as licensed sales agents.\nAl licensed salespersons and associate brokers are agents of the designated broker\nand/or the brokerage and should have a written employment agreement with the desig-\nnated broker and/or the brokerage that indicates their status as employees or independent\nIndependent Contractor or Employee\nThe Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982 provides that licensed\nreal estate agents may be classi\ufb01ed as independent contractors exempt from classi\ufb01ca-\ntion as employees by the Internal Revenue Service. A salesperson must meet the follow-\ning criteria to be eligible as an independent contractor:\n1. Be a licensed real estate agent\n2. Receive all income in the form of commissions from his or her designated broker only\n3. Have a written contract giving the agent's status as an independent contractor\nFor salespeople classi\ufb01ed as independent contractors, the designated broker can tell\nthem what to do but not how to do it. The broker may tell a salesperson that he or\nshe should list and sell houses but generally cannot insist that he or she attend meetings,\nwork a set number of hours, or hold open houses. However, the broker is responsible for\nthe salesperson's actions.\nThe independent contractor status is helpful to the brokerage because the brokerage\ndoes not have to pay Social Security tax or unemployment taxes for its salespersons and\nbrokers. (It may have to pay those expenses for receptionists or other staff who are\nChapter 1 \u2022 Real Estate Law and Real Estate Business\nemployees.) Neither does the brokerage have to provide any fringe bene\ufb01ts, such as\nhealth insurance. However, the brokerage must pay Workers' Compensation for all\nemployees and independent contractors. This is true unless the agreement between the\nbroker and the independent contractor speci\ufb01cally states that the independent contractor\nmust provide his or her own coverage. Workers' Compensation insurance covers staff\ninjured during the pursuit of the \ufb01rm's business.\nCompensation\nThe real estate broker is generally engaged by a seller through a listing agreement, which\nwill be covered in a later chapter. The compensation to the broker is established through\nnegotiations between the seller and the broker. The amount of compensation is set forth\nin the employment agreement and is often a percentage of the sales price.\nAnti-Trust Laws\nThere are no set commissions between the salesperson and the broker. A set commission\nfor all real estate brokerages would be considered price \ufb01xing, which is a violation of\nthe Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Under this federal law, brokerages cannot establish set\ncommissions or allocate customers and markets. For example, competing brokerages\nare forbidden from\n\u2022 Dividing the market into geographic areas, or\n\u2022 Dividing the market by certain prices of houses, thus avoiding competition.\nCommission Sharing\nReal estate brokerages are often described as either a commission sharing brokerage or a\n100 percent brokerage. A commission sharing brokerage means that a percentage of\nthe commission amount collected by the brokerage is paid to the salesperson. The com-\nmission sharing percentages generally range from 50 to 70 percent, depending on the\nexperience and volume of production by the licensed salesperson. For example, if the\ncommission split is 50 percent and the total commission collected by the brokerage\nwas $5,000, the salesperson would receive $2,500.\nAt a 100 percent brokerage, the salesperson receives all of the commission col-\nlected by the brokerage; however, the salesperson must pay a monthly fee to the broker-\nage and sometimes a transaction fee as well. The salesperson is also responsible for all of\nhis or her own expenses. The amount of the monthly fee and transaction fee varies\ndepending on the services provided to the salesperson by the brokerage. Newly licensed\nsalespeople most often begin their careers at commission sharing brokerages.\nIn both commission sharing and 100 percent brokerages, the commission paid to a\nreal estate salesperson can be paid only by his or her broker.\nARIZONA LICENSING LAW\nAll 50 states, including Arizona, require that individuals representing others in real\nestate transactions for compensation be licensed. Licensing is required to ensure that\nthe public is represented by competent individuals and to protect the public from\nfraud and other dishonest acts. Arizona licensing requirements are set forth in Article 2\nof the Arizona Real Estate Statutes, which are summarized below.\nLicense Requirements\nIt is unlawful for any person, corporation, partnership, or limited liability company to\nengage in business as a real estate broker or salesperson or to do any act for which a\nreal estate license is required without \ufb01rst obtaining a real estate license.\n",

Figure 1.1 summarizes the Code and Standards of Practice.\nFIGURE 1.1 National Association of REALTORS Code of Ethics\nDuties to Clients and Customers:\n\u2022 Protect and promote clients' inter-\nests while treating all parties hon-\nestly.\n\u2022 Refrain from exaggeration, misre-\npresentation, or concealment of\npertinent facts relating to property\nor transactions.\n\u2022 Cooperate with other real estate\nprofessionals to advance clients'\nb e s t interests\n\u2022 Make true position or interest\nknown when buying or selling on\nhis or her own account or for his or\nher family or \ufb01rm.\n\u2022 Refrain from providing profes-\nsional services when he or she has\nany present or contemplated in-\nterest in property without disclos-\ning that interest to all parties.\n\u2022 Disclose any fee received from re-\ncommending related real estate\nproducts or services.\n\u2022 Receive compensation from only\none party unless he or she has\nmade full disclosure and has re-\nceived informed consent from the\nclient.\n\u2022 Keep entrusted funds of clients and\ncustomers in a separate escrow\naccount.\n\u2022 Make sure that contract details are\nspelled out in writing and all par-\nties receive copies.\nDuties to the Public:\n\u2022 Give equal service to all clients and\ncustomers regardless of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, handicap, fa-\nmilial status, or national origin.\n\u2022 Maintain competence in his or her\n\ufb01elds of practice, get assistance\nfrom a knowledgeable profes-\nsional, or disclose any lack of ex-\npertise to the client.\n\u2022 Paint a true picture when advertis-\ning.\n\u2022 Refrain from engaging in the un-\nauthorized practice of law.\n\u2022 Willingly participate in ethics in-\nvestigations and enforcement ac-\ntions.\nDuties to Other REALTORS\u00ae:\n\u2022 Make only truthful, objective\ncomments about other real estate\nprofessionals.\n\u2022 Respect the exclusive, professional\nrelationships that other RE-\nALTORS\u00ae have with their clients.\n\u2022 Help settle \ufb01nancial disagreements\nwith other REALTORS\u00ae and their\nclients.\nChapter 1 \u2022 Real Estate Law and Real Estate Business\n1 3\nAlthough the Code of Ethics applies only to members of NAR, it establishes a pro-\nfessional standard to which all licensees should adhere.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nReal estate law is based on statutory law and common law. Statutory law includes the U.S.\nConstitution and state constitutions, laws enacted by Congress and the state legislature,\ndepartments of the federal and state bureaucracies, and ordinances adopted by local gov-\nemments. Common law is the basis for the legal system in all states, except Louisiana.\nThe real estate industry is divided into four main categories-brokerages, property\ndevelopment, property management, and appraising. Brokerages, managed by a desig-\nnated broker, provide for the completion of real estate transactions between buyers\nand sellers. Other licensed brokers, known as associate brokers, and licensed salesper-\nsons have the same privileges and responsibilities. These individuals should have a writ-\nten employment agreement indicating their status as either employees or independent\ncontractors. Brokerages tend to prefer independent contractors, because brokerages do\nnot have to provide bene\ufb01ts or pay Social Security and unemployment taxes for inde-\npendent contractors. However, the designated broker is still responsible for all actions\nof licensed salespeople and associate brokers.\nCompensation to the broker is established through negotiations between the seller\nand the broker. The amount of compensation is set forth in the employment agreement\nand is often a percentage of the sales price. Under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, price\n\ufb01xing is illegal. A real estate salesperson generally receives compensation in one of\ntwo ways. If the brokerage is a commission-sharing brokerage, then a percentage of\nthe commission amount collected by the brokerage is paid to the salesperson. If the bro-\nkerage is a 100 percent brokerage, the salesperson receives all of the commission col-\nlected by the brokerage, but the salesperson must pay a monthly fee to the brokerage.\nThe commission paid to a real estate salesperson can be paid only by his or her broker.\nArizona statutes de\ufb01ne the actions that require a real estate salesperson or broker\nlicense. These requirements and exemptions should be studied in full in the chapter\nor through the Arizona Department of Real Estate's Website: http://www.re.state.az.us.\nThe three types of general real estate licenses are real estate broker, real estate sales-\nperson, and real estate entity. In order to receive a broker license, the applicant must be a\nU.S. citizen or resident alien, be at least 18 years old, and have had at least three of his or\nher past \ufb01ve years' experience as a licensed salesperson. In addition, the applicant must\nhave taken 90 classroom hours and passed the school and the state exam. The require-\nments for a real estate salesperson license are nearly identical; however, applicants for a\nreal estate salesperson license are not required to have previous real estate experience. A\nbrokerage may be licensed as a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership. If\nthe brokerage is a business entity, then the brokerage must have a designated broker. The\ndesignated broker must be either an of\ufb01cer of the corporation, a manager or a member of\nthe limited liability company, or a partner of the partnership\nThe real estate examination consists of 140 multiple-choice questions (80 general\nand 60 Arizona-speci\ufb01c). Students must receive at least a 75 percent grade on both\nthe general and state portions of the exam to pass. Once an applicant has passed the\nstate examination, he or she has l year to activate the license.\nPrior to activating a salesperson license, the applicant must attend a 6-hour Contract\nWriting course. Before activating an original broker license, a broker must attend a 3-hour\nBroker Management Clinic. Arizona requires real estate licensees and brokers to renew\ntheir licenses every 2 years. License renewal is accomplished through completion of 24\nhours of continuing education. A license will expire if it is not renewed. A licensee has\n1 year to reinstate an expired license by paying fees and taking the required renewal\nclasses. During that year, the licensee may not function as a real estate licensee.\n",

It is possible to have separate ownership of the land sur.\nface and air rights. In some metropolitan areas, the railroads\nhave sold the air rights over their terminals and tracks to\nallow thedevelopment of high-rise of\ufb01ce complexes.\nWhen a unit in a high-nise condominium is purchased, a por-\ntion of the airspace is also acquired.\nUntil the develooment of air travel, the leaal de\ufb01nition of surface ownership\nincluded the area above the surface, and that de\ufb01nition was suf\ufb01cient to resolve\nmost legal disputes. Now, the courts generally permit reasonable use of the airspace\nby aircraft, provided that it does not interfere with the right to use and occupy the\nland. In some cases, govemments and airport authorities have purchased air rights ad-\njacent to airports for glide patterns.\nSubsurface Rights\nThe owner of the land surface rights also owns the subsurface rights, unless those\nrights have been previously sold or reserved by a prior landowner. The owner of the\nsubsurface rights is allowed to remove the underlying minerals, oil, or gas. The laws\nrelated to the acquisition or sale of subsurface rights vary by state, and often differences\nexist between the transfer of rights for minerals, such as copper, and for oil or for gas.\nWhen acquiring or selling land in an area known to include oil, gas, or minerals, the\nproperty's deed and other public records need to be examined to see if reservations con-\ncerning the transfer or retention of subsurface rights have been made.\nReal Estate\nReal estate is de\ufb01ned as the \"land\" (as de\ufb01ned above), plus\nman-made additions permanently attached to the Earth. These\naditions are called improvements, tenements, and\nappurtenances.\nTenements include any buildings on the land (for exam-\nple, a house, bam, garage, warehouse, of\ufb01ce, apartment, and\ns o o n .\nutilities.\nImprovements include sewers, sidewalks, streets, and\nAppurtenances are rights, privileges, or improvements\nthat belong to and pass with a property. For example, ease-\nments, nights of way, water rights, and mineral rights are all\nappurtenances.\nWATER RIGHTS\nWater rights and ef\ufb01cient use of water are vital to the growih and future development of\nArizona The common law doctrine, caled riparian rights, govers many states water rights.\nIn Arizona, panan righis apply only to the land rights of properties that border a waterway.\nChapter 2 \u2022 Land and Real Estate\n1 9\nLand Rights Under Riparian Doctrine\nThe ownership of land along a waterway depends on whether the waterway is navigable\nor non-navigable.\nNavigable Waterways\nIf the waterway is navigable, the landowner owns the land to the water's edge at the high\nwatermark, but no land below the water. The classi\ufb01cation of a waterway as navigable\nis made by the federal govemment and is based on whether the waterway is used for\ncommerce. The only navigable river in Arizona is the Colorado River. In the case of\na navigable river, the riverbed itself is owned by the state.\nNon-Navigable Waterways\nIf the waterway is non-navigable, the landowner owns the land beneath the surface of\nthe water to the center of the streambed at the low watermark.\nRiparian Rights vs. Littoral Rights\nRiparian rights are granted to owners of land located along a stream, river, or lake.\nThey generally apply to non-navigable waters. Consequently, someone with riparian\nrights owns the land beneath the surface of the water.\nLittoral rights are similar to riparian rights. Littoral rights are granted to owners of\nland that borders navigable lakes or oceans. These property owners may have full enjoy-\nment of the water, but they own only the land to the water's edge at the average high\nwatermark. Littoral rights are not applicable to any lakes in Arizona because there are\nno lakes in Arizona that are considered navigable by the federal govemment.\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nO w n e d\nb y\nPublic\nErosion, Accretion, and Avulsion\nA property owner may lose land through erosion or avulsion. Erosion is the gradual\nwearing away of land through processes of nature. Avulsion is a sudden loss of land.\nwhich may occur as a result of a sudden shift in a riverbed, volcanic action, an earth-\nquake, or another cause. A property owner may also gain land through accretion,\nwhich is a slow buildup of land by natural forces such as wind or water. The surface\nland gained by accretion is known as alluvion.\n",

The landowner has unrestricted use of the water;\nhowever, the owner may not contaminate or disrupt the \ufb02ow of the water. Only the ri-\nparian doctrine that relates 10 ownership of land next to a watenvay relates to Arizona;\nthe riparian doctrine related to water use is not applicable in Arizona.\nPrior Appropriation and Reasonable Use\nIn Arizona, all water rights are govemed by the doctrine of prior appropriation and\nreasonable use. Prior appropriation is often translated to mean \"\ufb01rst in time, \ufb01rst in\nuse.\" The policy of reasonable use declares that users must show bene\ufb01cial use\nof water requested and secure a permit. Requests for permits may be made for surface\nwater or groundwater. The State Department of Water Resources controls the use of\nwater in the state.\nThe Arizona Department of Water Resources enforces the groundwater laws. Before\ndrilling a well for domestic use, stock watering, a domestic water utility, or industrial or\ntransportation purposes, the owner must \ufb01le a Notice of Intent with the Department of\nWater Resources. For all other purposes, it is necessary to show bene\ufb01cial use and se-\ncure a permit.\nSurface water permits must be obtained to be sure that there is suf\ufb01cient water to\nsatisfy the needs of all potential users. The user holding the recorded permit with the\noldest date has the legal right to \ufb01rst use the water. Then, the second oldest permit\nmay use the water to satisfy his or her needs, and so on, until all of the water is used.\nIrrigation water permits must be obtained from the Arizona Department of Water\nResources for irrigation water, whether for surface or groundwater. The date the permit\nwas recorded determines the order of priority for use.\nPerfected Water Rights\nA completed and perfected water right is appurtenant to the land and passes with title.\n\u2022 Water rights remain valid for 40 years and may be renewed.\n\u2022 Water rights may be lost through intentional abandonment or by \ufb01ve consecutive\nyears of non-use.\n\u2022 Water rights do not grant the holder access to the water sources. Access and right\nof way must be obtained from the owner of the property.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF REAL ESTATE\nThe characteristics of real estate can be divided into two main classi\ufb01cations: economic\nand physical.\nEconomic Characteristics of Real Estate\ninvestments, and situs.\nThere are four economic characteristics of real estate: scarcity, improvements, \ufb01xed\nChapter 2 \u2022 Land and Real Estate\n2 1\nScarcity\nThere is no shortage of land on Earth, even though there is a \ufb01xed amount of it. Scarcity\nmeans a lack of land in a given area that is suitable for desired development. In Arizona,\nfor instance, there is plenty of land for development if there is suf\ufb01cient water. As\nArizona's population continues to grow, more and more agricultural land is converted\nto urban use, which demonstrates the theory of supply and demand and the economic\nchange in the land's value due to scarcity.\nImprovements\nAfter improvements are made to a parcel of land, an economic ripple effect may be\nnoticed on the neighboring properties. If a major shopping center is developed in an\narea of directional growth, it will not be long until apartments, of\ufb01ces, residences.\nmotels, and business services will follow in that area. As a classic example, look at\nthe development of the Phoenix area around the 101 freeway and Desert Ridge Market-\nplace in the last decade.\nFixed Investments\nBecause a real estate investment in a business complex or industrial site usually takes 2 0\nto 30 years to pay for itself, investment in real estate must include long-range planning.\nFixed investments include capital investments, labor, improvements such as utilities and\nsewers, and maintenance. Even a private residence usually represents the largest individ-\nual investment of a lifetime and is a \ufb01xed investment for a long period of time.\nSitus\nConsidered the most important economic characteristic in real estate, situs, or area prefer-\nence, is de\ufb01ned as the people's choice of a given area. Situs can be based on a beautiful\nview or on the proximity of employment, schools, or cultural centers. It may also be com-\npletely subjective and based upon personal preferences. Transportation, labor, market, high-\nway, or rail access could also be reasons for preference in a commercial or industrial site\nPhysical Characteristics of Real Estate\nThere are three physical characteristics of real estate: immobility, indestructibility, and\nnonhomogeneity.\nImmobility\nAll real estate is immobile because it has a \ufb01xed location. Some soil may be lost through\nerosion or \ufb02ood damage, but there is always more land beneath it.\nIndestructibility\nLand is said to be indestructible. Even though few structures remain of the early Spanish\ncivilization in this area, the land and the natural landmarks are virtually the same as in\nthe days of Francisco Coronado, Father Kino, and other early explorers in Arizona. This\ncharacteristic of durability is one of the reasons people think investments in real estate\nare preferable to stocks and bonds, metals, and commodities.\nNonhomogeneity\nSometimes called heterogeneity, the term nonhomogeneity means that no two parcels of\nreal estate are alike. If for no other reason, every parcel of real estate is in a different\n",

Often, properties wil differ in\nsize or topography, or the improvements wil be different.\nBecause no two parcels are alike, the courts of law recognize this characteristic of\nland as non-fungible, which means \"cannot be substituted for.\"\nPhysical and Economic Factors Affecting Land Use\nListed below are examples of physical and economic factors that affect land use.\n\u2022 Contour and elevation of land- Roling hills are considered ideal for residences,\nwhile a level area would be preferable for commercial or industrial property. The\ncontours of land are referred to as topography.\n\u2022 Prevailing winds are important in relation to locations of industrial centers and\nresidences. For example, even though copper smelters were located miles away from\nTucson, the air quality in Tucson was affected due to air currents.\n\u2022 Transportation is an important factor in considering the location of a commercial or\nan industrial business.\n\u2022 Public improvements, such as parks and airports, will be a factor in site selection\nwhether residential, commercial, or industrial.\n\u2022 Natural resources such as water, power, mineral deposits, and soil all affect land use.\n\u2022 Weather conditions, such as extreme heat and cold, have a great effect on land use.\nExtreme weather conditions can be bene\ufb01cial to an area, as evidenced by the ski\nresorts operating in northem Arizona. The development of air conditioning in\nArizona is largely responsible for Arizona's population growth. Air conditioning\nhas changed the negative effect of the summers in central and southem Arizona,\nwhich experience average high temperatures of 103\u00b0F.\n\u2022 Employment opportunities-If an area has all the positive effects of the above factors\nand no employment opportunities, there would be little desire for the land.\n\u2022 Population growth has perhaps the greatest effect on land use.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nLand is legally de\ufb01ned as the Earth's surface including downward to the center of the\nEarth and upward to in\ufb01nity, as well as all things permanently attached to the surface\nby nature. Land includes surface rights, perennial plants, air rights, and subsurface\nrights, such as minerals, oil, and gas.\nReal estate is de\ufb01ned as the land, plus man-made additions permanently attached to\nthe earth. These additions are called improvements, tenements, and appurtenances. Tene-\nments include any buildings on the land. Improvements include sewers, sidewalks,\nstreets, and utilities, Appurtenances are rights, privileges, or improvements that belong\nto and pass with a property,\nRiparian rights related to the ownership of land along a waterway depend upon\nwhether the waterway is navigable or non-navigable. If the waterway is navigable,\nthe landowner owns the land to the water's edge at the high watermark, but no land\nbelow the water. If the waterway is non-navigable, the landowner owns the land beneath\nthe surface of the water to the center of the streambed at the low watermark.\nLittoral rights are granted to owners of land that borders navigable lakes or oceans.\nLittoral rights are not applicable to any lakes in Arizona. Property owners may lose land\nthrough erosion or avulsion. Property owners may also gain land, through the process of\naccretion.\nChapter 2 \u2022 Land and Real Estate\n2 3\nIn the United States, water use rights are governed by two primary doctrines: the\nriparian doctrine and the doctrine of prior appropriation. In Arizona, all water rights\nare govemed by the doctrine of prior appropriation and reasonable use. Prior appropri-\nation is often translated to mean \"\ufb01rst in time, \ufb01rst in use.\" The policy of reasonable use\ndeclares that users must show bene\ufb01cial use of water requested and secure a permit. A\ncompleted and perfected water right is appurtenant to the land and passes with the title.\nReal estate has both economic and physical characteristics. Economic characteris-\ntics include scarcity, improvements, \ufb01xed investments, and situs. Physical characteristics\ninclude immobility, indestructibility, and nonhomogeneity. Certain physical and eco-\nnomic factors may combine to affect land use and value, including, but not limited\nto, natural resources, weather conditions, employment opportunities, and population\ngrowth.\naccretion\nnon-navigable waterways\nair rights\nphysical characteristics of real estate\nalluvion\nprior appropriation\nappurtenances\nr e a l estate\navulsion\nreasonable use\neconomic characteristics\nriparian rights\no f real estate\nSitus\nerosion\nsubsurface rights\nimprovements\nt e n e m e n t s\nland\ntopography\nlittoral rights\nwater rights\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nnavigable waterways\nCHECKING YOUR COMPREHENSION\n1.

After the fall of the\nRoman Empire, the feudal system became more popular in most parts of Europe. In the\narea that continued to be in\ufb02uenced by Roman law, the allodial system prevailed and\nlandowners had absolute title with few limitations.\nChapter 3 \u2022 Real and Personal Property\n27\nHistory of Feudalism\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, the people of Wester Europe turned to local leaders\nto protect their lands. They tumed their lands over to the local leaders, who in tum pro-\ntected them and granted them certain rights in the land. This practice survived several\ngenerations and resulted in ownership that was no longer absolute-one person\nowned the land and another or many others had an interest in it. The person holding\nthe land or in possession of it was similar to a tenant who owed goods or services to\nthe overlord for the use of the land, as did the overlord to his authorities.\nFiefdoms\nIn 1066, the Norman Conquest brought a more sophisticated form of feudalism to\nEngland. In an effort to consolidate his power and keep his fellow Normans in England,\nWilliam the Conqueror declared all English lands forfeited to him. Then as supreme lord\nof all lands, he distributed land as \ufb01efs. A \ufb01ef is an estate held as a condition of service\n10 another. Holders of \ufb01efs were not given absolute ownership; they owed a service 10\nthe king, which could be military, supplies, food, or personal. Land was also given to\nreligious leaders in return for religious support of the king. This practice resulted in a\nBecause the land always belonged to the king, if a tenant died and the heirs were\nminors, the king became guardian of both the heirs and the land and retained the pro\ufb01ts.\nIf a tenant died and had no heirs, his land or claim escheated, which means that his land\nor claim transferred to the sovereign power. This part of the feudal system still exists\ntoday in the United States. Later in this chapter, the current governmental limitation\nThe Statute of Quia Emptores, passed by Edward 1 of England in 1290, enabled a\ntenant to sell his land, but it required the new owner of the land to continue to pay the\ngoods, services, or feudal duties connected to that tenancy. This statute- -along with\nthe changes in the economic and political conditions-led to the payment of money\nrather than services and eventually caused the end o f the tenure system o f\nlandholdings.\nU.S. Ownership\nIn the time of the early U.S. settlers, land was held in tenure by the colonists and a small\npayment of money called a quitrent was paid to the king. The holder of a large section of\nland would subdivide it into smaller sections; however, because so much land was avail-\nable on the frontier, this system was virtually ignored.\nAfter the American Revolution, the quitrent system was abolished and people were\ngiven absolute ownership of the land, known also as allodial ownership. In the United\nStates, the Bill of Rights established the right of individuals to own land free from gov-\nemment control.\nOWNERSHIP RIGHTS\nIn law, property usually refers to rights that people have to use what they legally own,\nsuch as furniture, cars, and so on. The item itself is not as important as the right to use\nthat item as you choose, so long as it does not infringe on the law.\nThe bundle of rights, also called property rights, in the Bill of Rights refers to both\nreal and personal items. The differences between real and personal property will be\nexplained later in this session. The \ufb01ve rights included in the bundle of rights are:\n1. Control-Total control within the framework of the law.\n2. Possession-The right to have and to hold.\n",

Usually\none thinks of police power as the operation of police, \ufb01re, sanitation, and the health de-\npartment of a city. Other responsibilities of police power that have a distinct bearing on\nreal estate are planning, subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances, and building codes.\nThe Enabling Acts generally require that the zoning codes adopted by the local govern-\ning body be consistent with a plan for development. In Chapter 6, we will cover local\nzoning regulations in more detail.\nChapter 3 \u2022 Real and Personal Property\nTaxation is the goverment's right to levy taxes against real and personal property\nin order to provide city, county, and state govemmental services for the bene\ufb01t of the\npeople.

Local, state, or\nfederal goverments can use the right of eminent domain. The property is appraised, and\nfair market value is offered for the property. The govemment will attempt to negotiate\nand reach an agreement without initiating court action. If the owner refuses the offer, a\ncourt hearing is held to exercise the right of eminent domain. This process is called\ncondemnation.\nEscheat refers to the right of the state to take property from a deceased person's\nestate when there is no will and no heirs can be located.\nIn addition to the govemment powers described above, the federal govemment also\nhas a wartime power called con\ufb01scation, which gives the goverment the right to seize\nproperty without compensation in the interest of national security.\n2 9\nREAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY\nProperty can be classi\ufb01ed in two groups-real property and personal property. An over-\nall classi\ufb01cation, called a hereditament, is the most inclusive classi\ufb01cation of property. A\nhereditament includes anything capable of being\ninherited, both real and personal property.\nIn some countries, possessing and owning land\nwere much more important than amassing money or\npersonal items because land ownership carried with\nit voting rights. If a land owner was removed from\nhis land, he could bring immediate action in the\nReal Property equals:\nReal Estate\ncourts to recover that land.

Personal property can be conveyed, encumbered, or assessed\nf o r taxes.\nGrowing Crops and Their Transfer\nCourts divide growing crops (called emblements) into two categories. Annual crops,\ncalled fructus industriales or fruits of the industry, include such things as wheat, cotton,\noats, and com, and they are considered personal property. Crops that grow on perennial\nroots, such as trees, bushes, and vines, are called fructus naturales, and they are gen-\nerally considered real property.\nThe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), adopted in all states, de\ufb01nes annual crops\nas goods, which are considered personal property. An effective salesperson makes pro-\nvisions in the listing agreement as well as in the purchase contract that eliminate the\nneed to discuss what land or crops will transfer.\nFIXTURES\nA \ufb01xture is an item that was once tangible, personal property that has been attached to\nand made a part of the land or improvements. Real property is immovable and includes\neverything permanently attached to the land. Therefore, \ufb01xtures that were once per-\nsonal property become real property when they are permanently attached. Examples\nof \ufb01xtures include an air-conditioning system, fumace, kitchen cabinets, or a garbage\ndisposal.\nOne way to test whether the item is real property (a \ufb01xture) or personal property is\nt o remember the acronym MARIA:\nM\nA\nR\nMethod of Attachment A refrigerator is not usually a \ufb01xture because it is\nsimply plugged in, whereas bookshelves could be either real or personal\nproperty, depending on whether they are permanently attached. A dish-\nwasher is generally a \ufb01xture because it is secured to the wall and/or\nsurrounding cabinets and connected to the plumbing.\nAdaptability. If an item such as a sunscreen were manufactured to \ufb01t an\nirregularly sized window, it should be classi\ufb01ed as a \ufb01xture and remain with\nthe property in the event of a sale. Other examples include custom drapes,\ncustom Venetian blinds, and custom window shutters. Typically, whenever\nthe description of personal property is modi\ufb01ed by the word custom, it\nsuggests that the item was specially adapted for the subject property and,\ntherefore, is considered a \ufb01xture.\nRelationship of Parties. If a tenant installs a ceiling fan, he or she no doubt\nconsidered it personal property and hopes to remove it when he or she\nleaves. If an owner installed the same item, it could be classi\ufb01ed as a\n\ufb01xture,\nIntent of Annexor. The intent of the annexor is considered the most\nimportant test of a \ufb01xture. The other four tests given here are used to clarify\nthe intent of the annexor.\nAgreement of Parties. To avoid disputes over whether an item is a \ufb01xture or\npersonal property, it is wise to delineate in the contract any item that could\nequipment, drapes, and so on.\nbe considered in either classi\ufb01cation, for example, TV antenna, pool\nproperty.\nCost is not a factor in determining whether an item is classi\ufb01ed as a \ufb01xture or personal\nChapter 3 \u2022 Real and Personal Property\n3 1\nTrade Fixtures\nTrade \ufb01xtures are items that are the personal property of a tenant or owner and used to\ncarry on his or her business. Even though attached to a building, they may be removed\nby the tenant or owner, provided they are removed before the lease expires or the sale\nof the property is completed. If not removed in time, the trade \ufb01xtures become the\nproperty of the landlord or the new owner. If there is any damage to the building\nby removing the trade \ufb01xture, the building must be repaired. Examples of trade \ufb01x-\ntures include restaurant equipment, store shelves, display cases, and beauty shop\nequipment.\nChanging Classi\ufb01cation\nWith the exception of trade \ufb01xtures, \ufb01xtures become real prop-\nerty by attachment and the other MARIA test factors. It is also\ntrue that real property can become personal property. For exam-\nple, if a pine tree is cut down, it becomes personal property\nwhen it is removed from the earth because it is now moveable\nand unattached. The pine tree is then taken to a mill and made\ninto lumber (still personal property). Then it is sold and used\nin building a home; the pine tree is attached, and so it becomes\nreal property.\nreal property\nr e a l property\nTangible vs. Intangible Assets\nReal and personal property are also assets. An asset is something of value, a useful item\no f property, owned b y a person. Assets can b e classi\ufb01ed a s tangible o r intangible\nTangible assets are corporeal, which means having a body. Tangible assets are visible.\nIntangible assets are incorporeal, which means without a body. Intangible assets\nare invisible.\nReal property is generally a tangible asset. Personal property is either tangible, such\nas a car, or intangible, such as a patent, copyright, or trademark.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nThe two historic systems of land ownership are the feudal system and the allodial sys-\ntem. In a feudal system, all the land belongs to a king or queen and everyone owes rent\nor services to a superior. The allodial system established absolute ownership. In early\nU.S. history, land was held in tenure by the colonists, who had to pay a quitrent to\nthe king. After the American Revolution, the quitrent system was abolished and the allo-\ndial system prevailed. The Bill of Rights established the right of citizens to own land\nfree from govemment control.\nThe Bill of Rights also established property rights, known as the \"bundle of rights.\"\nThe bundle of rights includes the rights of control, possession, quiet and peaceful enjoy-\nment, disposition, and encumbrance.\nAlthough the bundle of rights grants as much freedom as possible, there are limita-\ntions on an owner's rights. These limitations are the rights of others and govemment\nrights. The rights of others include deed restrictions, easements, tenants, and lenders. Gov-\nemment rights include police power, taxation, eminent domain, and escheat. Police power\nis the govemment's right to enact laws for the common good. Eminent domain is the gov-\nemment's right to take private property for public use, after paying compensation to the\nowner. Taxation is the government's right to levy taxes against real and personal property.\nTaxes on real estate include ad valorem taxes and special assessments.

Real property is real estate that is owned, which means that the owner has\nproperty rights. Personal property is moveable. Everything that is not real property is\nclassi\ufb01ed as personal property.\nGrowing crops are called emblements, and they are divided into two categories.\nFructus industriales consists of annual crops, these crops are considered personal prop-\nerty. Fructus naturales consists of perennial crops; these crops are considered real\nproperty.\nA \ufb01xture is an item that was once tangible personal property but has since been per-\nmanently attached to and made a part of the land or improvements. Trade \ufb01xtures are per-\nsonal property items used by a tenant or owner to carry on his or her business. Even\nthough trade \ufb01xtures are attached to a building, the tenant or owner may remove them.\nReal and personal property are also considered assets.\nAn asset is something of value\nowned by a person. Assets can be classi\ufb01ed as tangible or intangible. Tangible assets are\nvisible and corporeal, which means having a body. Real property is generally a tangible\nasset Intangible assets are invisible and incorporeal, which means without a body.\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\ngovernment rights\nallodial system\nasset\nbundle of rights\ncondemnation\ncon\ufb01scation\nemblements\neminent domain\nescheat\nfeudal system\n\ufb01ef\n\ufb01xtures\nfructas industriales\nfructas naturales\nhereditament\nintangible assets\nMARIA\npersonal property\npolice power\nproperty\nreal property\nrights o f others\ntangible assets\ntaxation\ntrade \ufb01xtures\nUniform Commercial Code\nCHECKING YOUR COMPREHENSION\n1.

Many students, however, have dif\ufb01culty translating a word\nproblem into a math problem. For a helpful tip on understanding word problems, use\nthe following guide:\nThe word of usually means \"multiply.\"\nThe word is implies the word \"equals.\"\nThe \"T\" formula will be used throughout this book to solve different types of prob-\nlems. The \"T\" formula is an aid in solving word problems and works as follows.\nThere are always three factors in a percentage problem. Two factors\nwill be stated in the problem, and the third unknown factor will be the an-\nswer to the problem.\n\u2022 If the two factors known are below the line, multiply to \ufb01nd the part.\n\u2022 If one known factor is above the line, and the second known factor is\nbelow the line, divide the one above the line by the one below to \ufb01nd\nthe missing factor.\nBefore we practice, one word of caution: If the rate is given as a percent-\nage or a fraction, it must be changed to a decimal before the problem can\nb e solved.\nCommission Problems\nFor commission problems, the following additional information should be considered\nwhen applying the \"T\" formula.\nPART OF THE TOTAL =\nCommission Payment or Net Proceeds\nRATE =\nCommission Rate or\nNet Percentage Received\nTOTAL -\nSales Price\nPractice Problems\nEXERCISE 1: Broker Sam Seller receives $4,900 commission. His list-\ning stated he was to receive a 7 percent commission. What was the sale\nprice of the home?\nDivide the item on top, $4,900, by the rate, 0.07, which results in the answer of\n$70,000.\nEXERCISE 2: What would the gross commission be if a S65,000 home\nwas sold and the seller paid the broker a 7 percent commission?\nMultiply the total sales price, $65,000, by the rate, 0.07, which results in a\ncommission of $4,550.\nEXERCISE 3: What is the broker's commission rate if she receives a\ncommission of $3,450 on a $57,000 sale?\nDivide the commission, S3,450, by the total sales price, 857,000, which results\nin a rate of 0.06, or 6 percent.\nEXERCISE 4: The owner lists a property with a broker at a price that will net the\nseller S$6,000 after paying a 7 percent commission. What is the listed price? (rounded)\nWhenever you are given a net \ufb01gure, it will be a part of something larger, called the gross\namount. In this problem, the seller wants to net S56,000. That means that the net plus the\ncommission is 100 percent (gross amount). If the commission is 7 percent, the net must be\n93 percent. To \ufb01nd the gross amount, you simply divide the net amount by 0.93.\nAREA PROBLEMS\nMeasurements\n16.5 feet = 1 rod, perch, pole\n320 rods = 1 mile\n5280 feet = 1 mile\n1760 yards = 1 mile\n43,560 square feet = 1 acre\n208.71 \u00d7 208.71 feet = 1 square acre\nSurface Area\nA rectangle is a four-sided area whose sides are at right angles to each other.

To add fractions, convert all of the fractions to the low-\nest common denominator and then add the numerators.\nPercent means parts per 100. To change a percentage to a decimal, divide by\n100. To change a decimal to a percentage, move the decimal point two places to\nt h e right.\nTo change a fraction to a percentage, simply reverse the process above by \ufb01rst con-\nverting the fraction to a decimal and then multiplying by 100, changing it to a percent-\nage. To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator.\nWhen adding or subtracting decimals, the most important thing to remember is to\nline up the decimal points. Multiplying decimals is the same as multiplying whole num-\nbers except for the correct placement of the decimal. To do this, count the number of\nplaces in the numbers to be multiplied. Then count off the same number of places in\nthe answer and place the decimal there. If you are dividing a whole number into a dec-\nimal, put the decimal in the same place in the answer. If you are dividing by a decimal\nnumber, \ufb01rst change it to a whole number.\nWhen solving word problems, the \"T\" formula may prove helpful. There are al-\nways three factors in a percentage problem. Two factors will be stated in the problem,\nand the third unknown factor will be the answer to the problem. If the two known factors\nare below the line, multiply to \ufb01nd the part.

A legal description is consid-\nered adequate if a competent surveyor can locate the real estate as described.\nReal estate contracts require a legal description as one of the essential elements of a\nvalid contract. Therefore, all listings, purchase contracts, deeds, mortgages, and so on\nrequire legal descriptions, leases generally do not require a legal description. Conse-\nquently, it is important to understand the different legal description methods used in\nAnzona.\nThe following are the basic methods used in legal descriptions:\n1. Metes and bounds description\n2. Rectangular survey (also called govemment survey)\n3. Map and plat description (also known as lot and block description)\nChapter 5 \u2022 Legal Descriptions\nMETES AND BOUNDS DESCRIPTIONS\nMetes and bounds descriptions are the oldest form of legal descriptions used in the Unit-\ned States. This type of description was used in England and by all 13 original colonies.\nMetes and bounds descriptions are still used exclusively in the easter United States\n(19 states) and Texas. In other sections of the country, metes and bounds descriptions are\nused as a secondary method (along with the rectangular survey) to describe irregularly\nshaped or very small parcels of property.\nIn the early days of the United States, metes and bounds descriptions used land-\nmarks for the point of beginning and boundaries. These natural and man-made land-\nmarks, known as monuments, were trees, banks of streams, fences, or roads. The\npoint of beginning indicates the place where the surveyor begins to describe the parcel\nin terms of the distance and direction from that point.\nAs an example of this type of informal survey, a description dated 1665 in New\nLondon, Connecticut, follows:\n1665. Laid out for George Geer one hundred acres of upland, granted to him by the town of\nNew London, July ye 24, 1665, and is laid out as follows. Beginning upon the side of the hill\nat a white oak tree marked of four sides, standing about a mile from his own house, and from\nthence southerly upon a straight line running one hundred rods to a white oak tree marked on\nfour sides; and from thence westerly and straight line one hundred and sixty rods to a white\noak tree marked on four sides; and from thence northerly upon a straight line one hundred\nrods, running down a hill to a large tree standing by a run of water marked on four sides,\nand south to the \ufb01rst bound mark here we did begin upon a straight line. This laid out as\nabove written, highways included. Per us,\nALEXANDER PYGAN,\nJAMES MORGAN,\nSurveyors\nJOHN B STUBBINS\nA true copy of the record examined. Per EDWARD HALLAM, Recorder.\nThese descriptions were not entirely accurate because natural landmarks could\nchange or be lost as years passed. Consequently, metes and bounds descriptions now\nuse permanent monuments, such as iron posts, and surveying instruments to give accu-\nrate distance and direction.\nFormal Metes a n d Bounds\nThe formal metes and bounds survey uses a permanent man-made monument that i s\nplaced in the ground by the surveyor at one comer of the parcel. This monument is typ-\nically an iron pin one to two inches in diameter driven several feet into the ground. Start-\ning from this point of beginning, the surveyor creates a metes and bounds legal\ndescription, which indicates distance (metes) and direction (bounds). From the point\nof beginning, the surveyor describes the parcel's outside lines by compass and distance\nuntil the description ends at the point of beginning.\nDistances and Descriptions\nDistances are measured in feet, usually to the nearest tenth or one-hundredth of a foot.\nDirections are compass readings shown in degrees, minutes, and seconds. There are 360\ndegrees (*) in a circle, 60 minutes (*) in a degree, and 60 seconds (**) in a minute. When\nwe refer to a southwest direction, it indicates that south is the \ufb01rst direction and west is\nthe direction of the departure from south.\nIf a description is N 30\u00b0 E, the line we are looking for is 30\u00b0 east of due north. If we\nlocated N 45\u00b0 W, we would face north and the line would be halfway between due west\nand due north, since 90\u00b0 is always at right angles and the compass is divided into 360\u00b0.\n",

At that time, the country was \"land rich\" and needed a way to use the\nland to fund public services. The Land Ordinance of 1785 contained a plan for dividing\nthe land to create small, affordable parcels so that land ownership could become a reality\nfor people of average means, not just the wealthy. The Ordinance divided the land into\ntownships of 36 square miles and then divided each township into 36 sections of\n1 square mile (640 acres) each. Each section could be purchased and divided further\nby the purchaser. Section 16, which was centrally located in each township, was set\naside for school buildings. This method helped settlements spread in an orderly way\nacross the western territories. This system of description is known a s rectangular\nsurvey or government survey.\nMeridians and Base Lines\nThe rectangular survey is based on imaginary north-south lines called meridians, which\nare parallel to the longitudinal lines, and east-west lines called base lines, which are par-\nallel t o the latitudinal lines.\nThis system is based on mathematics and a standard land unit (a section) of uniform\nshape and area with the boundaries physically marked on the ground.\nThe Land Of\ufb01ce in Washington, D.C. was responsible for the establishment of the\n35 principal meridians and base lines throughout the United States (Figure 5.1).\nGila and Salt River Base Line and Meridian\nThe \ufb01rst step in putting this type of survey system into operation is determining an initial\npoint. In Arizona, this was established at the meeting of the Gila and Salt River (115th\nAvenue) and the intersection of Baseline Road.\nFIGURE 5.1\nPrincipal Meridians and\nBase Lines\nSource: Bureau of Land Management\n",

The base line is\nBaseline Road. In legal descriptions, this is known as Gila and Salt River Base Line\nand Meridian (G&SRBM). The Gila and Salt River Meridian runs north and south\nfrom Utah to Mexico, and the base line covers the area east and west from New Mexico\nto Califomia (Figure 5.2).\nThe G&SRBM was created in 1865. In 1869, a small area in the northern part o f\nthe state was changed to the Navajo Meridian and Base Line and designated by the\nNew Mexico state govemment to describe part of the Indian reservation. Currently,\nNew Mexico does not use this meridian, but it still exists for a small section o f\nArizona.\nRanges and Township Lines\nEvery 6 miles, parallel to the principal meridian, there are north-south lines called range\nlines. They run north and south, but they measure the space east and west of the prin-\ncipal mendian. The ranges are coded RIE, R2W, and so on.\nEvery 6 miles, parallel to the base line, there are east-west lines called township\nlines. These strips, also called tiers, measure the space north and south. They are num-\nbered north and south of the base line as TIN, T4S, and so on (Figure 5.3).\nCorrection Lines-Government Checks\nDue to the curvature of the earth, it is necessary to make corrections every 24 miles on\nthe meridian lines. To accomplish this, guide meridians and standard parallels were\nestablished every 24 miles. The guide meridians are called \"Ist Guide Meridian, East\nor West,\" and so on, according to the distance from the principal meridian. The Standard\nparallels are caled \"Ist or 2nd Standard Parallel, North or South,\" and so on, according\nto the distance from the base line.\nThese 24-mile squares are called government checks. They each contain 16\ntownships. Because the range lines follow the curvature of the earth, there is an almost\nChapter 5 \u2022 Legal Descriptions\nFIGURE 5.3\nRanges and Township\nLines\n4g\nRanges West\nRanges East\nTownships\nT4N\nR4W\nT4N\nR3W\nTAN\nR2W\nT4N\nRIW\nT4N\nR1E\nT 4 N\nR 2 E\nT4N\nR3E\nT4N\nR4E\nT3N\nR4W\nT3N\nR3W\nT3N\nR2W\nT3N\nR I W\nT3N\nR1E\nT3N\nR2E\nT 3 N\nR3E\nT3N\nR 4 E\nNorth\nT2NI\nT2N\nR 3 W\nT 2 N\nR2W\nT2N\nR1W\nT2N\nR1E\nT2N\nR 2 E\nT2N\nR3E\nT2N\nR4E\nB a s e\nT I N\nR4W\nT I N\nR3W\nTIN\nR2W\nT I N\nR1W\nT I N\nR 1 E\nT I N\nR2E\nT I N\nR 3 E\nT I N\nR 4 E\nLine\nTownships\nSouth\nT I S\nR4W\nT1S\nR3W\nT 1 S\nR2W\nT1S\nR1W\nT 1 S\nR 1 E\nT I S\nR2E\nT1S\nR 3 E\nT1 S\nR4E\nT 2 S\nR4W\nT 2 S\nR3W\nT 2 S\nR2W\nT2S\nR 1 W\nT2S\nRIE\nT 2 S\nR 2 E\nT 2 S\nR3E\nT2S\nR 4 E\nT3S\nR4W\nT3S\nR3W\nT 3 S\nR2W\nT3S\nRIW\nT3S\nR1E\nT 3 S\nR 2 E\nT 3 S\nR3E\nT3S\nR4E\nT 4 S\nR4W\nT 4 S\nR3W\nT4S\nR2W\nTAS\nRIW\nT 4 S\nR1E\nTAS\nR 2 E\nT 4 S\nR3E\n-24 miles\nT4S\nR4E\nPrincipal Meridian\n200-foot difference between the east-west measurement from the \ufb01rst township in\ncheck.

The air rights\nare described using a local datum to describe the airspace sold. In addition to the air-\nspace, small parcels of land must be purchased for support. These support foundations\nare called caissons. The Pan Am Building in New York City and the Merchandise Mart\nin Chicago, both built over railroads, are examples of the use of air lots.\nCondominiums sell the airspace along with common areas, such as elevators, stairs,\nhalls, grounds, and any recreational facilities, such as a swimming pool, meeting room,\nor other amenity. Chapter 7 provides more information about condominiums.\nDatum is a point of reference to which heights and depths are referred. The national\ndatum is located at the mean (average) sea level in New York Harbor. Almost all cities of\nany size have established a local datum to which surveyors can refer. Datum is used in\nreference to air lots for descriptions.\nA bench mark is a brass marker embedded in a road or permanently attached to a\ntree or iron post to give the elevation based on the of\ufb01cial datum. Therefore, a surveyor\ncan start at any bench mark 10 set elevations for a given area. If no local datum is estab-\nlished, the U.S. Geodetic Survey datum is used, which covers the whole nation.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nThere are three basic methods used in legal descriptions-metes and bounds descrip-\ntions, rectangular survey (also called govemment survey), and map and plat descriptions\n(also known as lot and block descriptions).\nMetes and bounds descriptions are used in 20 states. In other sections of the country,\nmetes and bounds descriptions are used as a secondary method. Early metes and bounds\nboundaries. The point of beginning indicates the place where the surveyor begins to de-\nboundaries use natural landmarks caled monuments for the point of beginning and\nscribe the parcel. Metes and bounds descriptions now use surveying instruments and\nThe formal metes and bounds survey uses a permanent monument that is placed in\nthe ground by the surveyor at one comer of the parcel. Starting from this point of be-\nginning, the surveyor creates a metes and bounds legal description, which indicates dis-\ntance (metes) and direction (bounds). From the point of beginning, the surveyor\ndescribes the parcel's outside lines by compass and distance until the description ends\nat the point of beginning.\nChapter 5 \u2022 Legal Descriptions\nDistances are measured in feet. Directions are compass readings shown in degrees,\nminutes, and seconds. There are 360 degrees (\u00b0) in a circle, 60 minutes (* in a degree,\nand 60 seconds (*) in a minute. To prepare a metes and bounds description, simply add\nthe distance to the directional points.\nThe system of description known as rectangular or government survey started\nwith the Land Ordinance of 1785, which contained a plan for dividing the land, creat-\ning small, affordable parcels. The Ordinance divided the land into townships of 36\nsquare miles, and then divided each township into 36 sections of 1 square mile\n(640 acres) each. Each section could be purchased and divided further by the\nThe rectangular survey is based on imaginary lines called meridians and base\nlines. Meridians are north-south lines parallel to the longitudinal lines. Base lines\nare east-west lines parallel to the latitudinal lines. This system is based on mathematics\nand sections of uniform shape and area, with the boundaries physically marked on the\nThe Land Of\ufb01ce in Washington, D.C. established 35 principal meridians and base\nlines throughout the United States. In Arizona, the principal meridian is called the Gila\nEvery 6 miles, parallel to the principal meridian, there are north-south lines called\nrange lines. They measure the space east and west of the principal meridian. The ranges\nare coded RIE, R2W, and so on.\nEvery 6 miles, parallel to the base line, there are east-west lines called township\nlines. These strips, also called tiers, measure the space north and south. They are num-\nbered north and south of the base line as TIN, T4S, and so on.\nDue to the curvature of the Earth, it is necessary to make corrections every 24 miles\non the meridian lines. To accomplish this, guide meridians and standard parallels were\nestablished every 24 miles. These 24-mile squares are called govemment checks. They\neach contain 16 townships. Each township has 36 sections. Each section is 1 square mile\nand contains 640 acres. The sections in a township are always numbered in the same\nway, with section #1 in the NE corner and section #36 in the SE corner. When a town-\nship is corrected, the corrections are con\ufb01ned to sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 18, 19, 30,\nand 31. These are known as fractional sections.\nA section is the smallest area surveyed by the govemment survey system, but land\nownership is most often less than a section. In a legal description of a portion of a sec-\ntion, individual sections break down into halves and quarters, and those quarters break\ndown into still smaller halves and quarters. Usually, 2.5 acres is the smallest subdivision\no f a section.\nA written legal description starts with the smallest portion, with each successively\nlarger parcel described until reaching the initial point (G&SRBM). When locating a par-\ncel of land from a written description, start with the largest portion \ufb01rst, reading from\nright to left.\nTo calculate acreage in a legal description, multiply the denominators of the legal\ndescription until you come to the word \"and.\" Then divide that number into 640\nacres. Start over after the word \"and\" by multiplying denominators until the end of\nthe description. Divide the denominator into 640 acres, and then add the two quotients\nto get the number of acres.\nThe map and plat description is the best system for describing small, subdivided\nproperties in urban areas. The map and plat description is also known as a lot and\nblock survey. A plat is a survey that shows the location and boundaries of individual\nproperties, dedicated streets, parks, ete. All developers who subdivide tracts of land\ninto six or more parcels, each containing less than 36 acres, must \ufb01le a subdivision\nplat map before any parcels can be sold.\nA surveyor or land engineer surveys the plat into lots, streets, and blocks. Each\nblock is given a number, and each lot is also numbered. Dimensions and exact sizes\nof each lot are given as well. After receiving approval, the plat map will then be recorded\n5 5\n",

This act\ngranted sections 16 and 36 of each township for the bene\ufb01t of the common schools, cur-\nrently referred to as public schools Endowment of public lands for educational purposes\nwas a practice established by the Northwest Ordinance in 1787. Congress quickly recog-\nnized the value of the land and the importance of public schools to a developing nation.\nThe State Enabling Act, passed on June 20, 1910, allowed the territory of Arizona\nto prepare for statehood. In addition to the previously designated sections of land, the\nEnabling Act assigned sections 2 and 32 of each township to be held in trust for the\ncommon schools. The needs of other public institutions were considered by Congress\nand, through the Enabling Act, more than two million additional acres were allocated\nf o r their use\nIn addition, a 1929 act authorized an additional 50,000 acres for the Miners' Hos-\npital Trust An 1881 act had already granted the temtory of Arizona about 60,000 acres\nfor the University of Arizona Trust. The total acreage of land granted was about\n10,900,000. Today, state trust land is apportioned among 14 bene\ufb01ciaries.\nState Land Commission\nOn May 20, 1912, an act of the First Legislature created a three-member State Land\nCommission to serve as the temporary Land Department of Arizona. The members\nwere charged with assessing, evaluating, and making recommendations about the land\ngranted by Congress for the common schools and other institutions. The Commission\nwas to report back to the legislature with its \ufb01ndings and conclusions by the end of\nthe second legislative session.\nThe Commission concluded that Arizona should not sell its trust land outright, as\nother states had done. Instead, it should put the lands to their highest and best use. The\ndecision to sell or lease the land should be based upon the potential use of each parcel.\nThe Commission recommended the creation of a permanent State Land Department\nwith the overding responsibility of attending to the numerous details associated with\nmaintaining the state's many land interests.\nState Land Department\nIn 1915, the State Land Code established the State Land Department and the system for\nmanaging trust lands. In compliance with the Enabling Act and the state Constitution,\nproducts from these trust lands.\nthe State Land Code gave the Department authority over all trust lands and the natural\nSince the State Land Department's inception, its dual missions have been to manage\nthe land trust and to maximize its revenues for the bene\ufb01ciaries, All uses of the land\nmust bene\ufb01t the trust, a fact that distinguishes it from the way public land, such as\nparks or national forests, may be used. While public use of trust land is not prohibited,\nit is regulated to ensure protection of the land and reimbursement to the bene\ufb01ciaries for\ni t s use.\nhtp://www.land.state.az.us.\nInformation on History of Arizona Land Trust tken frote Arizona State Land Deparument website:\nChapter 6 \u2022 Government Land Ownership and Use Controls\n6 1\nMethods of Land Acquisition\nArizona has acquired lands in four types of transactions:\n1. School Sections in Place. As land surveys were completed by the federal govemment,\ntitle to four school sections in each township-Sections 2, 16, 32, and 36- \u2014automatically\npassed t o Anzona.\n2. Indemnity in Lieu Selections. When school-section lands were not available to\nArizona because they had been previously claimed by homesteaders or miners, or\nbecause they fell within a federal reservation or a national forest, park, or Indian\nreservation, the state was given the right to select an equal acreage of federal public\ndomain land as indemnity in lieu of the school sections the state should have received.\n3. Quantity Grant Selections. Arizona selected the speci\ufb01ed acreage of federal lands\nfor the county bonds and each of the individual institutional trusts.\n4. Land Exchanges. After acquiring title to the trust lands, Arizona traded many of\nthe lands for other federal or private lands of equal value in order to relocate and block\nup trust land holdings.\nThe state acquired its School Sections in Place wherever the land surveys placed them.\nThe state chose the lands acquired in the Indemnity in Lieu Selections, Quantity Grant\nSelections, and Land Exchange processes.\nState Selection Board\nLand choices for the Indemnity in Lieu Selections, Quantity Grant Selections, and Land\nExchange processes were made by the State Selection Board, which originally con-\nsisted of the govemor, state attorney general, and state land commissioner.\nthe state treasurer has replaced the land commissioner on the board. Most of the selec-\ntions were made in the 1915-1960 era, with the selection program \ufb01nally completed in\n1982. Because federal laws kept the state from acquiring mineral lands, and because the\nhomesteaders had already acquired most of the potential agricultural lands, the state fo-\ncused on choosing the best grazing lands.\nMost of the acreage chosen during the 1915-1960 era was in central and southeast-\nem Arizona and along the railroad across north central Arizona. As agriculture devel-\noped in Arizona, selections were made in irrigated areas in the Harquahala Valley and\nthe Gila River Valley. The \ufb01nal selections concentrated on commercial and agricultural\nlands along the Colorado River.\nLand exchanges in the 1935-1985 era relocated most of the school section lands out\nof the wester deserts and into areas close to Phoenix and Tucson and into better grazing\nlands in such areas as wester Yavapai County.\nLocation and Uses of State Trust Land\nMost of Arizona trust lands are currently usable only for livestock grazing purposes.\nFortunately, several hundred thousand acres of these grazing lands have become\nurban lands as Phoenix, Tucson, and other cities and towns have expanded. The\nUrban Lands Act, passed in 1981, enabled the trust to capitalize on the signi\ufb01cant in-\ncrease in raw land values that result from planning and zoning. Today, the Land Depart-\nment's urban lands lease and sale program is the largest revenue producer for the trust.\nNearly all of the most valuable urban trust lands (around the northem border of the\nPhoenix metropolitan area and north and west Tucson) are common schools trust lands.\nThe large block of trust lands on the south and southeast sides of the Tucson metropol-\nitan area is divided among the various institutional trusts.

However, the majority of the acreage in the other individual institu-\ntional trusts is rural grazing land, although some agricultural potential exists.\nSince becoming a state in 1912, Arizona has disposed of, or exchanged, about\n1,628,079 acres of trust lands. A total of 9,228,787 acres of trust land remains. Almost\nall of the lands are under one or more leases for natural resource uses and commercial\ndevelopment purposes. About 87 percent of the trust lands are in the Common School\nTrust and approximately 90 percent of the trust revenues go to that trust.\nLAND USE CONTROLS\nLand use controls are divided into several classi\ufb01cations: public land use control, private\nland use control, and public ownership of land.\nPolice power (one of the govemment powers) allows the govemment to adopt\nlaws that limit private property land use through planning requirements, zoning ordi-\nnances, subdivision regulations, building codes, and environmental protection. The\nmain purpose of police power is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of\nthe community. Police powers, which are granted by the 14th Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution, pass the rights to the cities and counties through the State Legislative\nEnabling Acts. Subdivision regulations and environmental protection will be covered in\nlater chapters.\nCommunity Planning\nHistorically, the \ufb01rst city in the nation to develop a community plan was Washington,\nD.C., with the McMillan Plan in 1901. The second city to do so was Chicago, with\nthe Burnham Plan.\nCities and counties in Arizona are required to complete community plans known as\nGeneral or Comprehensive Plans. Community planning is a continuous process intended\nto guide the preservation, development, or redevelopment of a neighborhood, commu-\nnity, or region, and to promote the goals and ambitions of its residents. Quality of\nlife, infrastructure, and land use are typically key considerations in the process. Com-\nmunities need to prudently manage and direct their growth-strained resources to assure\nan economic future consistent with their goals. Communities appoint planning commis-\nsions and employ urban planners to aid in the completion of the planning process. The\nCommunity Planning Of\ufb01ce of the Arizona Department of Commerce is also available\nto provide statewide technical assistance and training to Arizona's municipalities and\ncounties.\nGrowing Smarter and Growing Smarter Plus legislation adopted in 1998 and\n2000, respectively, established the General Plan requirements for Arizona municipalities\nand counties. Some required elements of a plan include:\n\u2022 Planning for land use covering uses for housing, business, industry, and agriculture.\n\u2022 Establishing standards for population density and building intensity for each land use\ncategory.\n\u2022 Planning for circulation consisting of the general location and extent of roads,\nfreeways, bicycle routes, and other modes of transportation, all in correlation to the\nland use plan.\n\u2022 Planning for open space acquisition and preservation that includes the following:\na. Inventory of open space areas, recreational resources, and access points\nb. Analysis of future needs, policies for managing and protecting open space areas,\nand strategies for acquiring additional open space and establishing new recrea-\ntional resources\nc.

The\nplan is effective for up to 10 years from initial adoption or until a new plan is adopted.\nBefore the plan's tenth anniversary, the plan must be readopted or a new plan must be\napproved.\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (EIS)\nThe purpose of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is to gather information\nthat will demonstrate a positive or negative impact of a proposed project on the physical,\neconomic, and social environment of the area\nThe EIS is presented to the Planning & Zoning Commission, along with the de-\nvelopment application for approval. The statement is made available to the public and\nbecomes a part of the discussion at the public heaning.\nThe report includes information on the effect of the project:\n\u2022 Population, demographic density, growth, and so on\n\u2022 Traf\ufb01c congestion\n\u2022 Pollution (air, water, noise)\n\u2022 Recreation, wildlife, vegetation, conservation\n\u2022 Energy requirements\n\u2022 Public school enrollments\n\u2022 Health and safety (sanitation, water, and sewer systems)\n\u2022 Employment opportunities\nPreparing an EIS is time-consuming and costly-the cost is usually passed on to the\nconsumer. However, the environmental study's positive effects far outweigh these\ndisadvantages.\nZONING\nLocal communities and counties pass zoning ordinances to regulate use and control of\nland. The \ufb01rst zoning laws were passed in New York City in 1916 in order to restrict the\ngarment industry from encroaching on the fashionable Fifth Avenue business and resi-\ndential area. Today, most cities with populations of more than 10,000 have zoning\nrestrictions.\nZoning regulations are considered restrictions rather than encumbrances because\ntheir purpose is to improve and maintain property values and provide for orderly\ngrowth of the community.

These regulations usually include the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Dividing property into zones\n\u2022 Setting height and bulk of buildings\n\u2022 Designating use of buildings\n\u2022 Determining use of land\n\u2022 Limiting population density\n\u2022 Establishing setback lines\nClassi\ufb01cations of Real Property\nThe zones are established according to \ufb01ve general classi\ufb01cations- residential, commer-\ncial, industrial and manufacturing, agricultural and raw land, and special purpose\n(hospitals, airports, and schools) (Figure 6.1).\nThere are numerous divisions within each classi\ufb01cation. The divisions are referred\nto by codes such as R1 (single family), R2 (duplex), and so on. No standard code is used\nthroughout the United States or in Arizona; each community uses its own coding system.\nZoning Concepts\nOne popular zoning concept is the comprehensive development plan, which provides\nhousing, recreation, and commercial development in one self-contained development or\nin urban high-nise facilities where individuals can live, work, and play within the same area.\nA master planned community is a development consisting of two or more sepa-\nrately platted subdivisions and is subject to either: (1) a master declaration of covenants,\nconditions, or restrictions, (2) restrictive covenants that clearly indicate a general scheme\nfor improvement or development of real property; or (3) a master owner's association\nthat governs or administers the development.\nAnother popular development is cluster zoning. This type of zoning changes street\npatters and reduces the size of individual lots, but provides for the same number of res-\nidences with more open recreational space and less traf\ufb01c congestion than on a regular\ngrid pattem of subdivision. Cluster zoning is favored in parts of the country where peo-\nple desire an outdoor, recreational lifestyle (Figure 6.2).\nZoning Terms\nNonconforming use is a building or land use that does not confom to the zoning ordi-\nnance. Any building or land use that was in existence prior to the zoning ordinance may\nbe continued under a grandfather clause. The property cannot be remodeled, enlarged, or\nrebuilt (if destroyed), nor can the use of the property be changed. In the event of \ufb01re or\nConventional Layout\nChapter 6 \u2022 Government Land Ownership and Use Controls\nCluster Layout\nFIGURE 6.2\nConventional and Cluster\nLayouts\n65\nother destruction to the extent of 75 percent, the grandfather clause expires and the prop-\nerty will have to conform to present zoning restrictions. Also, if the nonconforming use is\nabandoned for 12 months or more, the current zoning will apply.\nA zoning variance represents a minor change in zoning for one speci\ufb01c property.\nA variance requires a hearing at which the property owner must show that the current\nzoning presents a hardship. An example would be a backyard pool that needs to be\ncloser to the side property lines than the zoning setback lines allow. A second example\nwould be property that, due to terrain or lot size, could not accommodate a house unless\nfront setback lines were minimally adjusted.\nA special use permit may be given by approval of the Planning & Zoning Com-\nmission for a property owner to develop a property in the public interest, as long as it\ndoes not interfere with the intent of the existing zoning. An example could be a site\nfor a new church. Another example would be a small restaurant in an industrial area\nto provide meals for workers.\nZoning changes may be initiated by a property owner or by the local govemment.\nIn either case, the zoning changes must be presented in a petition and at a formal hearing\nbefore the Planning & Zoning Commission. All property owners in the area must be\nnoti\ufb01ed of the public hearing. The Planning & Zoning Commission approves or rejects\nthe changes and forwards its opinion to the city council for \ufb01nal action. Approval by the\ncity council makes the change permanent. If the request for a zoning change is denied,\nproperty owners may go directly to the city council.\nWhen a zoning change is requested for an individual piece of property, as opposed\nto a change for an area, it is called spot zoning. The procedures are the same for all zon-\nDown zoning occurs when a property zoned for higher-density uses is rezoned for\nlower-density uses. For example, when land zoned for apartments is rezoned to single-\nfamily residential, the parcel is considered \"down zoned.\"\nA buffer zone is a strip of land that separates one land use from another. An exam-\nple of a buffer zone is a developer leaving a park or greenbelt between a commercial\no\ufb02ice center and a single-family residential subdivision.\nBuilding Codes\nBuilding codes regulate building construction for safety and public welfare. They estab-\nlish minimum construction standards and materials for all types of buildings. These in-\nclude protection, electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling, lighting, sanitation, and design\nand architectural standards.\n",

Public ownership provides land control for public use and bene\ufb01t.\nThe Arizona Land Trust is under public ownership. An Act of Congress established\nthe territory of Arizona and granted sections 16 and 36 of each township for the bene\ufb01t\nof the common schools, currently referred to as public schools. The Enabling Act also\nassigned sections 2 and 32 of each township to be held in trust for the common schools.\nThe total acreage of land granted to the trust was about 10,900,000. Today, state trust\nland is apportioned among 14 bene\ufb01ciaries.\nThe temporary State Land Commission decided that the lands should be put to their\nhighest and best use. Decisions to sell or lease the land should be based upon the po-\ntential use of each parcel.\nLater, the State Land Department was established and given authority over all trust\nlands and the natural products from these trust lands. The dual missions of the State\nLand Department are to manage the land trust and to maximize its revenues for the ben-\ne\ufb01ciaries. All uses of the land must bene\ufb01t the trust.\nArizona has acquired lands in four types of transactions: School Sections in Place,\nIndemnity in Lieu Selections, Quantity Grant Selections, and land exchanges. Except for\nthe School Sections in Place land, the land acquired in these transactions was chosen by\nthe State Selection Board.\nToday, the Land Department's urban lands lease and sale program is the largest rev-\nenue producer for the trust. Nearly all of the most valuable urban trust lands are common\nschools trust lands. Since statehood, Arizona has disposed of, or exchanged, about\n1,628,079 acres of trust lands. A total of 9,228,787 acres of trust land remain.\nLand use controls are divided into several classi\ufb01cations: public land use control,\nprivate land use control, and public ownership of land. Police power allows the govern-\nment to adopt laws that limit private property land use through planning requirements,\nzoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, and environmental\nprotection.\nCities and counties in Arizona are required to complete community plans known as\nGeneral or Comprehensive Plans. Community planning guides the preservation, develop-\nment, or redevelopment of a neighborhood, community, or region. Communities appoint\nplanning commissions and employ urban planners to aid in the completion of the planning\nprocess. The required elements of a General Plan vary for municipalities and counties. The\nplan is effective for up to 10 years from initial adoption or until a new plan is adopted.\nAn Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) demonstrates a positive or negative im-\npact of a proposed project on the physical, economic, and social environment of the area.\nAn Environmental Impact Statement usually includes information on population, traf\ufb01c\ncongestion, pollution, energy requirements, employment opportunities, and more.\nZoning ordinances regulate the use and control of land. Most cities with a popula-\ntion of more than 10,000 have zoning restrictions. Zoning regulations are considered\nrestrictions rather than encumbrances.\nZones are established according to \ufb01ve general classi\ufb01cations: residential, commer-\ncial, industrial and manufacturing, agricultural and raw land, and special purpose.\nOne popular zoning concept is the comprehensive development plan, which pro-\nvides housing, recreation, and commercial development in one self-contained\ndevelopment.\nChapter 6 \u2022 Government Land Ownership and Use Controls\nA master planned community consists of two or more separately platted subdivi-\nsions that are govemed by a master owner's association or subject to a master declara-\ntion or restrictive covenants.\nCluster zoning changes street pattems and reduces the size of individual lots, but\nprovides for the same number of residences with more open recreational space and\nless traf\ufb01c congestion.\nNonconforming use is a building or land use that does not conform to the zoning\nA zoning variance represents a minor change in zoning for one speci\ufb01c property.\nA special use permit may be given by approval of the Planning & Zoning Commis-\nsion for a property owner to develop a property in the public interest, as long as it does\nnot interfere with the intent of the existing zoning.\nZoning changes may be initiated by a property owner or by the local govemment,\nand the changes require approval by the Planning & Zoning Commission.

As Arizona continues to\ngrow, subdivision regulations have become a major factor in community planning and\nreal estate developments. Subdivision law and regulations are established at both the\nlocal and state government level.\nLocal Government Subdivision Regulation\nExcept for certain divisions of land parcels, all subdivisions of land must receive ap-\nproval of the county govemment of the municipal goverment if located within the\nboundaries of the city or town. Arizona statutes cover land divisions of \ufb01ve or fewer\nChapter 7 \u2022 Subdivisions\n7 1\nlots that are exempt from the othenvise required Commissioner's Public Report. These\nstatutes\n\u2022 Provide for the review of land divisions of \ufb01ve or fewer lots by the counties or\nmunicipalities.\n\u2022 Allow counties or municipalities to adopt ordinances and regulations for the review\no f such land divisions.\nLocal subdivision regulations include setting standards for streets; easements for util-\nities, sewers, water mains, and rights of way (including irrigation); lot sizes; setback\nlines; and areas reserved for schools, parks, and other recreational facilities, such as\nswimming pools, activity centers, golf courses, or tennis courts.\nSubdividers work with the local planning commission to submit a proposed subdi-\nvision for approval, which includes recording a survey, a detailed map and plat, and a\ndetailed proposal.\nStatewide Subdivision Law\nThe Arizona Real Estate Code (Title 32, Chapter, Articles 4 and 7) provides for the reg-\nulation of subdivided and unsubdivided land. These laws were enacted to prevent dis-\nhonest practices in the subdividing and sale of undeveloped land. The Code requires\nthat the subdivider obtain a Commissioner's Public Report (CPR) prior to offering\nany of the land parcels for sale. The purpose of the CPR is to ensure that purchasers re-\nceive complete and accurate disclosure of all material facts related to the subdivision.\nDe\ufb01nitions to Know\nA subdivision or subdivided land is de\ufb01ned as improved or unimproved land divided\nor proposed to be divided for the purpose of sale or lease, whether immediate or in the\nfuture, into six or more parcels of less than 36 acres each. This includes both condomin-\niums and cooperatives, but generally does not include the leasing of improvements for\ncommercial or industrial use. Unsubdivided land is six or more parcels, each measuring\nfrom 36 acres up to 160 acres.\nAn improved lot or parcel is a lot or parcel featuring a residential, commercial, or\nindustrial building. This term can also refer to a parcel that will feature one of these\nbuildings within 2 years per a current contract obligating the subdivider to complete\nits construction.\nAn unimproved lot or parcel is simply a lot or parcel of a subdivision that is not an\nimproved lot.\nRequired Approval\nBefore a subdivider can offer subdivided or unsubdivided lands, a Notice of Intention\nmust be \ufb01led with the Commissioner of Real Estate. The Commissioner will examine\nthe notice and then issue a public report authorizing the sale or lease of the lots, parcels,\nor fractional interests. Due to the de\ufb01nition of subdivided and unsubdivided lands, the\nrequirement covers the division of lands into six or more lots, parcels, or fractional inter-\nests. A fractional interest is an undivided interest in improved or unimproved land and\nlots or parcels of any size created for sale or lease.\nNotice of Intention\nFor help preparing a Notice of Intention, obtain a working checklist called Subdivided\nLands Questionnaire from the subdivision section of the Department of Real Estate.\nThe Notice of Intention will include the following:\n\u2022 Information about the owner and the subdivider\n\u2022 A statement as to the condition of title\n",

In this case, the subdivider \ufb01les a statement with the Commissioner indicating the\nchange of ownership, along with any material changes that have occurred since the orig-\ninal approval.\nThis exemption eliminates the need for the subsequent owner to \ufb01le another Notice\nof Intention. It does require an existing complete Commissioner's Public Report issued\nto a prior owner of the property. The subdivider claiming this exemption must contact\nthe Real Estate Department prior to its use and then fumish the buyer a public report\nand obtain a receipt.\nAssured Water Supply\nIf the subdivision is within a groundwater active management area, the subdivider must\naccompany the Notice of Intention with a certi\ufb01cate of assured water supply issued by\nthe director of water resources.

These rules\nwere established to speci\ufb01caly protect purchasers of unimproved property.\n1. Seller \ufb01nancing. The seller signs and delivers a deed transfeming marketable\ntitle. The deed and instrument must be recorded within 60 days after both parties\nsign.\n2. Escrow agent. The purchase contract is signed by the seller and must be recorded and\ndeposited within 60 days of execution. The seller provides the preliminary title report,\nthe deed conveying marketable title, and the lot release from any blanket encum-\nbrance. The documents must be recorded within 60 days after the purchaser has\nful\ufb01lled his or her obligation.\n3. Trustee. The procedures are the same as with the escrow agent, except that the\ntrustee will sign deeds and record items as necessary.\nInspection and Right of Rescission\nA protection against high-pressure tactics and a \"cooling off period\" are provided, in\nthat all contracts for the sale of unimproved parcels in a subdivision can be unilaterally\nrescinded without cause by the purchaser of the parcel as follows:\n1. If the parcel was not inspected prior to the offer, the purchaser has 6 months after\nsigning the contract to rescind the offer.\n2. Purchaser must sign an af\ufb01davit that he or she has inspected the parcel and therefore\nhas 7 days after signing the contract to rescind the offer.\nTo rescind the contract, written notice from the purchaser must be delivered to the\nseller no later than midnight of the \ufb01nal day, at which time all monies must b e\nreturned.\nINTERSTATE LAND SALES FULL DISCLOSURE ACT\nWhen developers of 25 or more unimproved lots in a subdivision sell or lease to citi-\nzens of another state as part of a Common Promotional Plan, the Interstate Land Sales\nFull Disclosure Act regulates the sale or lease. Unless exempt, the Act requires regis-\ntration with Housing and Urban Development that should include the following\ndisclosures:\n\u2022 Reports on environmental factors\n\u2022 Assurances on the developer's commitments to provide promised improvements\n\u2022 The availability of utilities and sewage facilities\n\u2022 Audited \ufb01nancial statements\nExemptions from the Act's registration requirements include the following:\n\u2022 The plan offers fewer than 25 lots or lots consisting of at least 20 acres each.\n\u2022 The lots contain an existing building on improved land, or the seller is obligated to\nerect such a building within 2 years.\n\u2022 A professional builder purchases the lots for the purpose of constructing residential,\ncommercial, or industrial buildings.\n\u2022 The lot is free and clear of al liens and encumbrances at the time of the sale and the\npurchaser has personally inspected the property.\nChapter 7 \u2022 Subdivisions\n7 9\nDEVELOPMENTS WITH COMMON ELEMENTS\nThe rapid growth of the Arizona population has caused an increase in the value of land\nAs a result, housing developments require more living units per acre. Developments\nwith common elements, including cooperatives, condominiums, planned unit develop-\nments, and time-shares, are all types of ownership designed to provide more affordable\nhousing and other bene\ufb01ts derived from increased living units per acre of land. All of\nthese developments are considered subdivisions and are regulated by state law.\nCooperatives\nCooperatives are generally organized as corporations, with the tenants owning the\nstock. A cooperative is usually \ufb01nanced by a combination of a mortgage on the land\nand improvements, plus the proceeds from the sale of stock to the cooperative owners.\nIn cooperative ownership, there is one mortgage and title for the building held in the\nname of the cooperative corporation. The individual purchaser of an apartment receives\nstock in the corporation and has a personal property interest in the form of a proprietary\nlease.\nIn a cooperative, the board of directors of the corporation develops a budget, which\ncovers anticipated expenses for principal and interest on the mortgage, taxes, insurance,\noperating, and maintenance of the common areas and grounds. Sometimes the budget\nalso includes a contingency amount for unexpected or long-term maintenance. The\nfunds for the budget are then collected from the leascholders in the form of an annual\nassessment, which is paid in monthly installments.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Cooperatives\nAdvantages of cooperative ownership include the association of stockholders, control-\nling the rent, and the approval of new purchasers.\nOne disadvantage of cooperative ownership is that there is no income tax deduction\nfor mortgage interest or property taxes. Also, the mortgage could go into default if\nenough individuals fail to pay their monthly assessments.\nCondominiums\nStarting in the late 1950s and 1960s, condominium ownership became very popular in\nthe United States due to population increases in metropolitan areas.\nTechnically, ownership in a condominium is individual fee simple ownership of a\nfractional interest, plus a share of the common elements and grounds of the property.\nThe apartment may be held in severalty, joint tenancy, tenants in common, or commu-\nnity property. The common elements are held as tenants in common with other unit own-\ners of apartments. If there were 300 units, the unit owner would own his or her unit and\n1/300th of the common elements.\nThis type of ownership is most often apartment-style housing, but it could also in-\nclude of\ufb01ce or commercial space.\nCommon Elements\nThe owner of a condominium purchases space referred to as a unit. A unit is a portion of\na condominium designated for separate ownership. Each unit owner receives a separate\ndeed. The owner can mortgage his or her unit and claim the interest and taxes a s a tax\ndeduction. Common elements mean all portions of a condominium other than units.\nLimited common elements are the portions of common elements speci\ufb01cally designed\nin the declaration and allocated for the exclusive use of one or more but fewer than\nall units.\n",

The HOA manages the common elements of the condominium development\nand ensures compliance with the HOA rules and the development's deed restrictions.\nPlanned Unit Development (PUD)\nPlanned Unit Developments (PUDs) are usualy high-density, single-family structures\nthat utilize the land area to the greatest possible extent. Ownership of a PUD is similar to\na condominium in that the single-family residence is fee simple ownership, in which the\nowner holds an undivided interest in the common elements with the other owners in the\nPUD as tenants in common. The major difference between a PUD and a condominium is\nthat the PUD is a single-family residence, whereas a condominium is an apartment, often\nin a multistory stricture.\nSimilar to a condominium, a PUD has an HOA to manage the common elements of\nthe development.\nHomeowners' Associations\nAl owners in a development with common elements are members of their HOA. The\nassociation has the power to\n\u2022 Adopt and amend bylaws and rules\n\u2022 Select a board of directors and of\ufb01cers with the power to act on behalf of the\nassociation within the limits of bylaws and Arizona law\n\u2022 Adopt and amend annual budgets for revenues, expenditures, and reserves for\ncommon areas\n\u2022 Collect assessments\n\u2022 Employ and discharge necessary personnel to manage the complex\n\u2022 Sign contracts and incur liabilities\nFor a summary of all HOA powers, see Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 33, Chapters 9,\n16, and 18.\nEach owner receives an individual property tax bill and a bill from the HOA for the\npro rata share of the association's operating expenses. The assessments bill from the HOA\nis usually a monthly bill and often includes a prorated share of insurance, plus the cost of\noperating and maintaining the common and exterior areas. Monthly assessments may also\ninclude utilities. In addition, the assessments could include a reserve fund for long-range\nmaintenance (such as new roofs or air conditioning systems for the whole complex), pro-\nvided the HOA membership approves.\nResale o f Units\nA planned community, including condominiums and planned unit developments, is a\nreal estate development that includes real estate owned by an association created for\nthe purpose of managing, maintaining, or improving the property, and in which the own-\ners of units are mandatory members and required to pay association assessments.\nWhen a unit in a planned community is resold, the seller has an obligation to make\ndisclosures to the potential buyer. Furthenore, the potential buyer should understand\nthe following factors:\n\u2022 Extent of the covenants, conditions, and restrictions\n\u2022 Financial status of the HOA association\n\u2022 Obligation for monthly or other periodic assessments\nChapter 7 \u2022 Subdivisions\n8 1\nDisclosure Requirements for Planned Communities\nThe Arizona Revised Statutes require that a buyer of a unit in a planned community be\nprovided the following information:\n1. A copy of the bylaws and the rules of the association.\n2. A copy of the declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs).\n3. A dated statement containing\na.

A copy of the most recent annual \ufb01nancial report of the association. If the report\nis more than 10 pages, the association may provide a summary of the report in\nlieu o f the entire report.\n6.

For example, twelve purchasers own one\nunit, with use designated for one month each year. The arrangement may call for a \ufb01xed\nmonth or the period may change each year. Each tenant signs an occupancy agreement.\n\u2022 Interval ownership. This type of ownership is based upon the life expectancy of the\nbuilding. An estate for years is granted with deed, title, and right to occupy for an\nagreed-upon time for each year.\n\u2022 Vacation ownership. This type of time-share ownership is based on a contract\ngranting a \"license to use\" the property. The developer retains the fee ownership and\ntransfers the right to occupy to purchasers for a speci\ufb01ed period each year.\nMembership Camping\nMembership camping is covered in Title 32, Chapter 20, Article 10 of the Arizona\nRevised Statutes. When purchasing a membership, a person buys a license to use a rec-\nreational facility. There is no real property interest involved; it is simply a right to use the\noperator's campground land.\nLand for a campground may be owned or leased by the operator. The operator may\nnot sell a membership that extends beyond the duration of the land's lease\nThe original purchaser of a membership cannot rent or lend his or her membership\nlo someone else, but he or she may sell the contract.\nMembership campgrounds may not sel any memberships until the Commissioner has\napproved the site in a manner similar to a subdivision or a condominium and time-shares.\nRescission\nA membership camping contract may be canceled by a resident purchaser for any reason\nbefore midnight on the third business day, or by the same time on the seventh calendar\nChapter 7 \u2022 Subdivisions\nday for a non-resident. This notice to cancel must be in writing and delivered personally\nor by certi\ufb01ed mail with retum receipt requested. All monies must be returned within\n30 days of receipt of the notice of cancellation.\nThe original contract must contain, in conspicuous type, the following statement:\nNOTICE TO PURCHASER\nYou are entitled to a copy of this contract at the time you sign it.\nYou may cancel this contract at any time, if a resident of this state, before midnight\nof the third business day, or if a non-resident of this state, before midnight of the\nseventh calendar day after receiving a signed copy of this contract. If you choose to\ncancel this contract, you must either:\n1. Send a signed and dated written notice of cancellation by certi\ufb01ed mail,\nreturn receipt requested.\n2. Personally deliver a signed and dated written notice of cancellation to:\n_ (Name of Campground)\n_(Address of Campground)\nIf you cancel this contract within the time periods set forth above, you are entitled\nto a full refund of your money. If the last day for giving notice falls on a Sunday or\nholiday, notice is considered timely given if it is mailed or delivered as speci\ufb01ed on\nthe next business day. The campground operator must make refunds within\n30 days of receipt of the cancellation notice.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nSubdivision law and regulations are established at both the local and state govemment\nlevels\nWith few exceptions, all subdivisions of land must receive approval of the county\ngoverment or the municipal government if located within the boundaries of the city or\ntown. Arizona statutes provide for the review of land divisions of \ufb01ve or fewer lots by\nthe counties or municipalities. They also allow counties or municipalities to adopt ordi-\nnances and regulations for the review of such land divisions.\nLocal subdivision regulations include setting standards for streets, easements for\nutilities, lot sizes, and more. Subdividers work with the local planning commission to\nsubmit a proposed subdivision for approval, which includes recording a survey, detailed\nmap and plat, and a detailed proposal.\nArticles 4 and 7 of the Arizona Real Estate Code were enacted to prevent dishonest\npractices in the subdividing and sale of undeveloped land. The Code requires that the\nsubdivider obtain a Commissioner's Public Report prior to offering any of the land par-\ncels for sale.\nA subdivider must \ufb01le a Notice of Intention with the Commissioner before offering\nsubdivided or unsubdivided lands. The Commissioner will examine the notice and then\nissue a public report authorizing the sale or lease of the lots, parcels, or fractional\ninterests.\nThe Commissioner may grant an exemption from the Notice of Intention require-\nments to a subdivider of lots or parcels within a subdivision for which a public report\nwas previously issued.\nIf the subdivision is within a groundwater active management area, the subdivider\nmust accompany the Notice of Intention with a certi\ufb01cate of assured water supply issued\nby the Director of Water Resources. This is not required if the subdivision is located within\nan area designated as having an assured water supply by the Director of Water Resources.\n",

This list of exemptions is long and detailed\nplease study the chapter text for speci\ufb01cs.\nThe Commissioner examines any subdivision offered for sale or lease and makes his\nor her \ufb01ndings public. A \ufb01ling fee must accompany the Notice of Intention.\nAner examining a subdivision, the Commissioner wil issue a public report to the\nsubdivider authorizing the sale or lease of the lots, parcels, or fractional interests within\nthe subdivision. Prospective purchasers of subdivided property must sign a receipt that\nstates they have been given a copy of the public report prior to signing any contract.\nThe Commissioner may suspend, revoke, or deny issuance of a public report on\ngrounds, such as the failure to comply with subdivision law or the rules of the Commis-\nsioner or the inability to deliver title.\nSubdividers normaly hire a broker to act as agent for the sale or lease of parcels.\nThe same requirements apply for advertising, promotional practices, and sales tactics\nin subdivided land as they do with any other area of real estate sales.\nPrior to obtaining a public report, a lot reservation may be accepted on subdivided\nor unsubdivided lands and improved or unimproved lots. Sales prices may be quoted.\nBefore accepting any lot reservations, the seller must deliver written notice of his or\nher intention to accept lot reservations to the Department of Real Estate.\nOne of three procedures must be used in the sale of unimproved parcels: The unim-\nproved parcel must be purchased through seller \ufb01nancing, an escrow agent, or a trustee.\nA protection against high-pressure tactics and a \"cooling off period\" are provided in all\ncontracts for the sale of unimproved parcels in a subdivision.\nWhen developers of 25 or more unimproved lots in a subdivision sell or lease to\ncitizens of another state as part of a common promotional plan, the Interstate Land\nSales Full Disclosure Act regulates the sale or lease. The act requires registration\nwith Housing and Urban Development that should include certain disclosures and\nalso includes speci\ufb01c exemptions detailed in the text.\nDevelopments with common elements, including cooperatives, condominiums,\nplanned unit developments, and time-shares are all types of ownerships designed to pro-\nvide more affordable housing. Al of these developments are considered subdivisions\nand are regulated by state law.\nCooperatives are generally organized as corporations, with the tenants owning the\nstock. In cooperative ownership, there is one mortgage and title for the building held in\nthe name of the cooperative corporation. The individual purchaser of an apartment\nreceives stock in the corporation and has a personal property interest in the form of a\nproprietary lease.\nOwnership in a condominium is individual fee simple ownership of a unit, plus a\nshare of the common elements and grounds of the property. The apartment may be\nheld in severalty, joint tenancy, tenants in common, or community property. The com-\nmon elements are held as tenants in common with other unit owners of apartments.\nThe owner of a condominium purchases space referred to as a unit. A unit is a portion\nof a condominium designated for separate ownership.\nPlanned Unit Developments (PUDs) are usually high-density, single-family struc-\ntures that utilize the land area to the greatest possible extent. The ownership of a PUD\nis similar to a condominium. The major difference is that the PUD is a single-family\nresidence, whereas a condominium is an apartment, often in a multistory structure.\nAl owners in a development with common elements are members of their home-\nowners' association. The association has the power to adopt and amend bylaws and\nrules, select a board of directors and of\ufb01cers, and more.\nWhen a unit in a planned community is resold, the seller has an obligation to make\ndisclosures to the potential buyer. Furthermore, the potential buyer should understand\nthe following factors: the extent of the CC&Rs, the \ufb01nancial status of the homeowners\nassociation, and the obligation for monthly or other periodic assessments. The\nChapter 7 \u2022 Subdivisions\n8 5\nresponsibility for the delivery of the required information depends on the number of\nunits in the planned community.\nTime-shares are a type of condominium ownership usually located at a resort or rec-\nreational area where the use of the property is desired for a short period each year. The\nde\ufb01nitions of \"time-share estate,\" \"time-share interval,\" \"time-share projects,\" and\n\"time-share use\" can be found in the text and in the Arizona Revised Statutes.\nThe statutes also provide for the rescission of contracts or agreements for time-shares.\nThe purchaser may rescind the contract without cause by delivering written notice of rescis-\nsion by midnight of the seventh day following the day on which the contract was written.\nThere are three types of time-share ownership: purchaser owns unit as tenant in\ncommon, interval ownership, and vacation ownership.\nMembership camping is also covered in the Arizona Revised Statutes. When purchas-\ning a membership, a person buys a license to use a recreational facility. Membership camp-\ngrounds may not sell any memberships until the Commissioner has approved the site in a\nmanner similar to a subdivision, condominium, or time-shares.

An encumbrance is a right or interest in a prop-\nerty held by someone who is not the legal owner of the property.\nThe two types of encumbrances are nonmonetary and monetary.\nNONMONETARY ENCUMBRANCES\nNonmonetary encumbrances affect the physical condition or use of property. Exam-\nples of this type of encumbrance are deed restrictions, easements, and encroachments.\nDeed Restrictions\nDeed restrictions are private limitations placed on land use. They are established at the\ntime a subdivision is developed, or when a property owner sels the land, and are included\nin each deed. When the deed restrictions uniformly affect all of the subdivision, they are\nitemized in a document caled the \"Unifom Declaration of Restrictions,\" or Covenants,\nConditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) and the deed wil only refer to that document.\nChapter 8 \u2022 Encumbrances\n8 9\nA deed restriction usually relates to land use, such as the type of building, square\nfootage, setbacks, color, or style. Deed restrictions cannot be used to discriminate on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; if they do, they are unenforce-\nable by the courts. Also, deed restrictions limiting the owner's rights (such as participa-\ntion in zoning hearings) would be unenforceable.\nDeed restrictions take precedence over zoning ordinances if the deed restrictions are\nmore limiting. They have time limitations but will renew if not voted down. If the cur-\nrent owners in the subdivision agree by 100 percent, a deed restriction may be changed.\nViolations of deed restrictions can lead to a court action. If a person violates one of\nthe CC&Rs, the homeowners must, at their own expense, bring a court action to enforce\ntheir deed restriction. If the homeowners delay action, they may lose their rights. The\ndelay in asserting one's right is called laches.\nEasements\nAn easement is an interest that entitles one party to some limited use of another party's\nland. It is created for a designated use only, such as a roadway for ingress (entrance)\nand egress (exit) to otherwise landlocked property. It is a nonpossessory interest and\nnot an estate in land. An easement creates a legal right to use someone else's real prop-\nerty and must be written and recorded with the county recorder to satisfy the Statute of\nFrauds. It is an intangible right and, once it is created, remains in effect until some\nspeci\ufb01c action is taken to terminate it. An easement is not terminated by sale o f\nproperty.\nTypes of Easements\nAppurtenant easements and easements in gross are the two types of easements.\n1. Appurtenant easements are attached to the land and if the property is sold, the\neasement is transferred to the new owner. Appurtenant easements are said to \"run\nwith the land.\" Examples of appurtenant easements include a driveway, road, party\nwall, or a common wall, as i n a condominium or townhouse.\n\u2022 The land on which the easement runs is the servient tenement or the \"one who\nserves.\" (See Property A in Figure 8.1.)\n\u2022 The landowner who bene\ufb01ts from the easement is said to be the dominant\ntenement. (See Property B in Figure 8.1.) For example, \"A\" owns a very large\nlot and decides to sell the back half of the property to \"B.\" There is a road only\nalong the front of A's property. Because it is illegal to sell landlocked land, A\nFIGURE 8.1\nServient Tenement and\nDominant Tenement\nB\nDominant\ntenement\n20' Easement\nServient\ntenement\nStreet\n",

A still has title to the road\nand must pay taxes on it. B has an interest in the road, and the casement is\nconsidered to belong to him (dominant tenement). B must pay for the main-\ntenance of the road.\n\u2022 An easement such as a party wal, when a fence is built on the property line with\nhalf on each person's property, is an example of an appurtenant easement. Each\nperson owns half of the fence on her property, and each owner has an easement on\nthe other's property.\n2. An easement in gross is the right to use the land of another. It is not appurtenant,\nwhich means it is not attached to the land. There is no dominant tenement in an\ncasement in gross. The two types of casements in gross are:\n\u2022 Commercial easement in gross. These easements can be assigned or transferred.\nThe sale of the property usually does not affect this type of easement. Examples\nwould include railroad for right of way, utility company for water and gas mains\nand/or for power, and telephone or cable television lines.\n\u2022 Personal casement in gross. A personal easement in gross cannot be assigned or\ntransferred and terminates with the death of the person to whom the easement\nwas granted or upon transfer (sale) of the subject property. An example would be to\ngive an easement in gross to allow a person to cross the owner's land to\nreach a lake.\nCreating Easements\nFour main methods are used to create casements:\n1. Express grants. Most casements are created by an express grant, which is usually\nexecuted by a separate deed. The rights, privileges, and duties would be clearly stated\nin the deed.\n2. Reservation in a deed. For example, the owner of a property maintains for himself the\nuse of a strip of land being sold as a driveway. The driveway easement is created\nby reservation in the deed, which transfers ownership to the new buyer.\n3. Necessity. Because it is illegal to sell landlocked land, an owner would have to grant\nan easement to allow ingress and egress to the property.\n4. Prescription. A method of acquiring an casement by continuous, open, hostile, and\nnotorious use for a period of 10 years without the consent of the owner.\nTerminating Easements\nEasements may be terminated by agreement of the parties. A quitclaim deed can be used\nto terminate the easement. The quitclaim deed must be recorded to remove the easement\nfrom the county records.\nA merger of the two properties can terminate the easement, for there is no\nlonger any need for it. A merger occurs when the same person or entity owns two\nparcels. To continue with the above example (shown in Figure 8.1), if Lot B is\nacquired by the owner of Lot A then the driveway easement for Lot B is terminated\nby merger.\nAn easement can also be terminated by abandonment or adverse possession. The\ntermination of an easement through adverse possession requires continuous, open, hos-\ntile, and notorious use for a 10-ycar period. Abandonment of an easement involves an\nintention to abandon with an act or an omission to act through which the abandonment\nintention is carried into effect.\nChapter 8 \u2022 Encumbrances\nFIGURE 8.2\nEncroachments\n91\nB\nEncroachment\nA\nA ' s\ng a r a g e\nB\nEncroachment\nProperty line\nImportant Terms\nThe following terms also relate to land use and property rights.\n\u2022 Pro\ufb01t or pro\ufb01t a prendre, generally considered a type of easement, is a right to\nremove soil, minerals, fruit, timber, or some product of the land with compensation to\nthe surface owner of the land. It is a nonpossessory interest in the land, limited to a\nparticular purpose, and can be created only by a written clause.\n\u2022 License is a personal privilege to use the land of another for a limited purpose; it\ncan be revoked at any time. A license is not an interest in land. Permission given to\ngo hunting on someone's property grants a license to use the land. The use of a\nparking garage is also generally a license.\nEncroachments\nAn encroachment is an intrusion upon another person's property without a right to use\nit. Encroachments can include structures, eaves, fences, overhanging branches, and so\non (see Figure 8.2). If the encroachment is a structure, it is called trespassing. In the\ncase of overhanging branches, it is known as a nuisance. The owner of the property\nbeing encroached upon has the right to force the removal of the encroachment. Failure\nto do so may eventually damage the owner's title.\nMONETARY ENCUMBRANCES\nMonetary encumbrances are also called liens. A lien is a claim or charge against a prop-\nerty as security for the payment of a debt or obligation. Liens affect the title of the prop-\nerty involved. Remember this helpful saying:\n\"All liens are encumbrances, but not all encumbrances are liens.\nClassi\ufb01cation of Liens\nThere are three classi\ufb01cations of liens:\n1. Contractual. In a contractual lien, the parties enter into a contractual agreement,\nsuch as a mortgage or trust deed.\n2. Statutory. Statutory liens are created by law, such as property taxes or special\na s s e s s m e n t taxes.\n3. Equitable. Equitable liens generally occur when the courts declare that justice would\nbe best served by the creation of a lien.\n",

Examples of general\nliens are judgments, internal revenue taxes, debts of a deceased person, and estate\ntaxes.\nSpeci\ufb01c liens affect only one speci\ufb01c property. These include property taxes, spe-\ncial assessments, mechanic's liens, surety bail bond liens, attachments, and vendor and\nvendee liens.\nVoluntary liens are created by voluntary actions of the individual, such as giving a\nmortgage or trust deed as collateral for loans on property.\nInvoluntary liens are created by law without action or consent of the individual.\nExamples include property taxes and court-ordered judgment liens.\nPriority of Liens\nLiens with the highest priority are superior to junior liens. The higher-priority lien elim-\ninates junior liens if the higher lien holder forecloses. Real property taxes have the high-\nest priority, followed by special assessments.\nThe priority of other liens is determined by the order in which the lien is recorded,\nexcept for mechanic's and materialmen's liens. Priority is established for these liens as of\nthe date the work began.\nARIZONA REAL PROPERTY TAXES\nOne of the govemment's powers is the right to tax real property. This tax is a lien on a\nspeci\ufb01c property and takes precedence over all other liens and encumbrances.\nArizona uses a single tax bill. The tax bill combines state, county, municipal,\nschool, and other district levies, such as an irrigation district, into a single statement\nfor payment to the county treasurer.\nThis property tax is caled an ad valorem tax, which means \"according to value.\"\nEach piece of property is taxed according to its assessed value.\nSetting the Tax Rate\nThe procedure for seting the tax rate is a complicated, time-consuming, yearly task.\nFirst, each government body (city, county, state, school district) estimates its budgel\nneeds for the year. After arriving at a projected expense budget, each division\nChapter 8 \u2022 Encumbrances\n9 3\ndeducts the expected income from fees, grants, or revenue sharing for the year.\nThe balance equals the amount to be charged against real property as ad valorem\ntaxes.\nEvery January, the county assessor's of\ufb01ce mails each property owner a notice of\nvaluation showing the full cash value and the limited value for each property. The\nfull cash value is the most probable price that property would bring in a competitive\nand open market. The limited value is calculated through a formula set by law, which\nrestricts how much the limited value may increase in any one year.\nThe notice also states the percentage for the different classes of property to be used\nfor the current year. For example, class-three property consists of single-family owner-\noccupied residences. The assessment valuation for class-three property is 10 percent of\nthe full cash or limited value.\nAssessed Value\nThe assessed value derived from the limited cash value is the basis for computing taxes\nfor the maintenance and operation of school districts, cities, counties, and the state. The\nassessed value derived from the full cash value is the basis for computing taxes for bud-\nget overrides, bonds, and sanitary, \ufb01re, and other special districts.\nThe Appeal Process\nA taxpayer who feels that the full cash value is too high may make an administrative\nappeal to the county assessor. A taxpayer can also appeal the classi\ufb01cation of the prop-\nerty. It is the responsibility of the landowner to prove to the assessor why the valuation\nshould be lower. Requesting a lower valuation must be evidenced by the valuation of\nother properties in the area, not simply an owner's desire to reduce his or her tax\nresponsibilities.\nA taxpayer may appeal the decision of the county assessor to the Board of Equal-\nization. The administrative appeal to the Board of Equalization must be made within\n30 days after the decision of the county assessor.\nA property owner who is dissatis\ufb01ed with the valuation or classi\ufb01cation of the prop-\nerty as determined by the county assessor may appeal directly to the court on or before\nDecember 15. The property owner must appeal to the county assessor (administrative\nappeal) within 30 days. The property owner, even if making an administrative appeal,\nmaintains the right to appeal to the courts, but must do so by December 1S. Also, a prop-\nerty owner who has \ufb01led an administrative appeal may \ufb01le an appeal with the court\nwithin 60 days of mailing the most recent administrative decision.\nLimitations and Due Dates\nAccording to Arizona law, property valuation cannot be increased by more than 10 per-\ncent per year, except for voter-approved bond issues or budget overrides.\nThe actual amount levied against an individual property cannot be increased by\nmore than 2 percent in any given year. Also, the total tax levied on an owner-occupied\nresidence cannot exceed 1 percent of its full cash value.\nImportant Dates\nProperty taxes become a lien on property on January 1, even though taxpayers do not\nreceive the tax bill until late August or early September. The \ufb01rst half of the current\nyear's tax is due on October l and is delinquent on November 1. The second half of\nthe tax is due on March 1 of the next year and is delinquent on May 1. The bill is\nsent on an annual basis, but the taxes may be paid in two equal installments to the county\ntreasurer of the county where the property is located.\n",

The rate is determined by dividing the amount of\nfunds needed by total assessments of al real estate within the jurisdiction of each taxing\nbody. A rate may be expressed in mils, or an amount per S100 of assessed value. A mill\nis 1/1000 of a dollar, or .001.\nExample: A residential property with a limited value of S152,800 is assessed at\n10 percent with a tax rate of 59.50 per $100 of assessed value.\n$152, 800 x 10 percent = $15,280 = assessed value\n$15, 280 divided by 100 = $152.80 (100's)\n$152.80 x $9.50 = $1,451.60 taxes\n1. What will the taxes be for 6 months on property assessed at S6,000 if the tax rate is\n$10.20 per $100 valuation?\n\u2022 Multiply 60 hundred by the rate per S100 and divide by 2 to get 6 months' taxes.\n2. If property is appraised at S68,000, and the property is assessed at 10 percent of the\nappraised value for tax purposes, and the tax rate is SI 1.80 per S100 of assessed\nvaluation, how much will the taxes be?\n\u2022 Multiply the appraised value times the decimal equivalent of 10 percent to get the\nassessed valuation. Now, multiply the tax rate times the number of hundreds to get\nthe annual taxes.\nTax Sale Process\nA penalty of 16 percent per annum or 1.33 percent per month will be imposed against all\ndelinquent taxes. A delinquent notice is mailed to the taxpayer in September.\nIf the delinquent taxes are not paid after receiving this notice, the tax lien will be\nsold for taxes in February. The treasurer mails a notice of sale of property to the tax-\npayer. The sale must be advertised in the newspaper at least 2 to 3 weeks before\nt h e sale.\nAt the treasurer's sale, the purchaser of the tax lien receives a Certi\ufb01cate o f\nPurchase. The successful bidder has to pay the back taxes and interest and also will\nhave to pay taxes during the owner's redemption period.\nRedemption Period\nDuring the owner's right of redemption, the owner has 3 years from the date of sale to\nredeem the property. To redeem the property, the owner must pay all of the past due\ntaxes, penalties, interest, and transfer fees. After 3 years, the property owner has a\nright of redemption at any time before the delivery of a Treasurer's Deed to the Certif-\nicate of Purchase owner.\nIn order to obtain ownership of the property, the Certi\ufb01cate of Purchase holder\nbrings an action in superior court in the county where the real property is located.\nThe court action is to foreclose the right of the real property owner to redeem the tax\nlien. The action to foreclose may begin at any time 3 years after the sale of the tax\nlien, but not later than 10 years after the last day of the month in which the lien was\nacquired.\nAt least 30 days before \ufb01ling the Action to Foreclose the Right to Redeem, but not\nmore than 180 days before the action is commenced, the Certi\ufb01cate of Purchase owner\nmust send a Notice of Intent to \ufb01le the foreclosure action by certi\ufb01ed mail. The Notice of\nIntent must be sent to the property owner of record and the county treasurer.\nChapter 8 \u2022 Encumbrances\n95\nThe Notice must include the following:\n1. The property owner's name\n2. The real property tax parcel identi\ufb01cation number\n3. The legal description\n4. The certi\ufb01cate of purchase number\n5. The proposed date of \ufb01ling the action\nWhen the court \ufb01nds that the sale of the tax lien is valid and that the tax lien has not\nbeen redeemed, a judgment is entered that\n\u2022 Forecloses the right of the property owner (defendant) to redeem\n\u2022 Directs the county treasurer to execute and deliver a deed conveying the property\ndescribed in the Certi\ufb01cate of Purchase\nAfter the judgment is entered, the property owner has no further right, title, or interest in\nthe property. The property owner may redeem the tax lien at any time before a judgment\nis entered even though the action has commenced.\nTreasurer's Deed\nAfter receiving a certi\ufb01ed copy of a judgment foreclosing the right to redeem and the\nstatutory fee, the county treasurer executes and delivers to the owner of the tax lien a\ndeed conveying the property.\nThe deed includes the following information:\n\u2022 Date, court action number, and name of the judgment\n\u2022 Name of the purchaser\n\u2022 Property description\n\u2022 Date of the conveyance\n\u2022 Formal acknowledgment by the treasurer\nSpecial Assessments\nSpecial assessments are improvements that enhance the value of property, such as\ncurbs, sidewalks, streets, sewers, and streetlights.\nThe improvement costs allocated to the individual property owner are assessed on a\n\"front foot\" basis. Front footage is the portion of the parcel, expressed in feet, that faces\nthe street as opposed to the depth of the lot.\nPayment for the special assessment may be made in one lump sum or paid in install-\nments over a 10-year period. Payment is due when the project is completed. If payment\nis not made within 30 days, it will automatically become an installment payment plan.\nEach year:\nIst half payable on May 1; delinquent June 1\n2nd half payable on November 1; delinquent December 1\nProperty may be sold for unpaid special assessment liens. The tax sale for special\nassessments is held in January. The owner has redemption rights until delivery of the\ntreasurer's deed to the new owner. Interest and penalties vary according to the length\nof period of default. They gradually increase from 5 percent for a 3-month period up\nto 20 percent for a year.\n",

This kind of lien is caled a mechanic's lien (when it refers to\nunpaid labor) or materialmen's lien (when it refers to unpaid materials).\nThe following persons do not have the right to \ufb01le mechanic's or materialmen's\nliens:\n1. A person required to be licensed as a contractor, but who does not hold a valid\nlicense\n2. A person who has not given 20-day notice and has not made proof of service\n3. A person who fumishes professional services but does not hold a valid certi\ufb01cate\nof registration\n4. A person who does not have a written agreement with the owner of the\nproperty or with an architect who has a written agreement with the owner of\nthe property\nA subcontractor or material supplier usually lacks a relationship with an owner\nand, as such, would be unable to assert any claim against an owner for labor or mate-\nrials according to a subcontract. However, the mechanic's lien statutes allow a sub-\ncontractor or a material supplier to pursue his or her remedies directly against\nthe owner.\nTwenty-Day Notice\nFor the protection of subcontractors and materialmen, Arizona created the requirements\nfor a preliminary 20-day notice. This noti\ufb01es the owner, general contractor, and lender\nthat if the subcontractor or materialman is not paid, a lien will be \ufb01led. The notice must\nbe made within 20 days after delivery of any materials or completion of labor. An im-\nportant segment of this notice is quoted here:\nNotice to Property Owner\nIf bills are not paid in full for the labor, services, quipment or materials fumished or to be\nfumished, a mechanic's lice may lead to the loss, through court foreclosure proceedings, of\nall or part of your property even though you have paid your contractor in full. You may\nwish to protect yourself against this consequence by (I) requiring your contractor to furnish\na signed release by the person or \ufb01m giving you this notice before making payment to your\ncontractor, or (2) any other method or device that is appropriate under the circumstances.\n(A.R.S. 33-992.01)\nFiling, Foreclosure, and Release\nThe general contractor must record the lien within 120 days of the completion of work.\nA subcontractor has 120 days after completion of the project to record the lien. The time\nfor all parties to record their lien is reduced to 60 days if a notice of completion is\nrecorded. The priority of the lien dates back to the beginning date of work by the general\ncontractor.\nIf payment is not made after recording the lien, the contractor must begin collection\nprocedures by \ufb01ling a foreclosure action. The foreclosure action must be \ufb01led within\n180 days (6 months), or the lien will be terminated.\nAfter payment, the contractor must issue a lien release within 20 days. The owner\nthen records the lien release in order to give constructive notice that the lien has been\nremoved from the property.\nChapter 8 \u2022 Encumbrances\n97\nJUDGMENTS, ATTACHMENTS, AND LIS PENDENS\nJudgments\nA judgment is the result of a court action in which one person brings a suit\nagainst another person. The court order is recorded in the county where the debtor\nlives. This action is attached to any property, real or personal, owned by the debtor.\nIf a person attempts to purchase a property with a new loan, the lender will require\nthe judgment to be satis\ufb01ed before the new loan will be granted. Because the\njudgment is against the person, when the deed is recorded the judgment will attach\nto the property prior to the new loan and the new loan would be considered a junior\nlien.\nJudgments are granted for a S-year period and can be renewed for S-year periods. If\na debtor does not satisfy the judgment, Arizona statutes provide for a writ of\nexecution to attach one's property and sell it to satisfy the debt.\nArizona law provides that a judgment creditor may (at any time there is a valid\njudgment lien) bring an action against the debtor for a writ of execution to enforce\nthe lien.\nTypes of Execution\nThere are two types of execution general execution and special execution.\n1. A general execution commands the of\ufb01cer to take the amount of the judgment out of\nproperty of the judgment debtor without specifying the particular property.\n2. A special execution commands the of\ufb01cer to sell certain speci\ufb01c property or to deliver\ncertain speci\ufb01c real or personal property to the entitled party.\nWrit of Attachment\nA writ of attachment is the legal process of seizing the real or personal property of a\ndefendant in a lawsuit and holding it in the custody of the court as security for satisfac-\ntion of a judgment.\nA writ of attachment is usually \ufb01led prior to the court action for judgment so that the\nproperty cannot be sold before the court has acted. In this case, the court has temporarily\n\"seized title.\"\nProcess Involved\nWhen a writ of attachment will be used, the creditor seeks a writ of attachment from\ncourt and records it, which creates a lien before the entry of a judgment. The plaintiff\nis then assured that there will be property left to satisfy the judgment.\nTo obtain attachment, the creditor has to post bond or deposit in order to cover pos-\nsible loss or damage that the debtor may sustain while the court has custody of the prop-\nerty, if the judgment is not awarded to the creditor.\nLis Pendens\nLis pendens (Latin for action pending) is a recorded legal document that gives con-\nstructive notice that an action affecting a particular piece of property has been \ufb01led in\na state or federal court. It does not prevent the sale of a litigant's property, but it does\nput any potential buyer on notice that the property may be affected by the result of\nthe lawsuit.\n",

An encumbrance is a right or interest in a\nproperty held by someone who is not the legal owner of the property. There are two\ntypes of encumbrances: nonmonetary and monetary.\nNonmonetary encumbrances affect the physical condition or use of property. Exam-\nples of this type of encumbrance are deed restrictions, casements, and encroachments.\nDeed restrictions are private limitations one places on land use. They are established at\nthe time a subdivision is developed or when a property owner sells the land, and are\nincluded in each deed. When the deed restrictions unifomly affect all of the subdivision,\nthey are itemized in a document caled the Uniform Declaration of Restrictions, or Cove-\nnants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs). Violations of deed restrictions can lead to a\ncourt action. If a person violates one of the CC&Rs, the homeowners must, at their own\nexpense, bring a court action to enforce their deed restriction. If the homeowners delay\naction, they may lose their rights. The delay in asserting one's rights is called laches.\nAn casement is an interest that entitles one party to some limited use of another par-\nty's land. Appurtenant casements are attached to the land and, if the property is sold, the\ncasement is transferred to the new owner. An easement in gross is the right to use\nthe land of another. It is not attached to the land. A commercial easement in gross\ncan be assigned or transferred. The sale of the property usually does not affect this\ntype of easement. A personal casement in gross cannot be assigned or transferred and\nterminates with the death of the person to whom the easement was granted or upon\ntransfer of the subject property.\nFour main methods are used to create casements: express grants, reservation in a deed,\nnecessity, and prescription. Easements may be terminated by agreement of the parties. A\nquitclaim deed can be used to terminate the easement. The quitclaim deed must be recorded\nto remove the easement from the county records. A merger of the two properties can also\nterminate the easement. A merger occurs when the same person or entity owns the two par-\ncels. An casement can also be terminated by abandonment or adverse possession.\nAn encroachment is an intrusion upon another person's property without a right to\nuse it. If the encroachment is a structure, it is called trespassing. In the case of overhang-\ning branches, it is known as a nuisance. The owner of the property being encroached\nupon has the right to force the removal of the encroachment. Failure to do so may even-\ntually damage the owner's title.\nMonetary encumbrances are also called liens. A lien is a claim or charge against a\nproperty as security for the payment of a debt or obligation. Liens affect the title of prop-\nerty involved. The three classi\ufb01cations of liens are contractual, in which the parties enter\ninto a contractual agreement, such as a mortgage or trust deed; statutory, such as property\ntaxes or special assessment taxes, that are created by law; and equitable, which generally\noccur when the courts declare that justice would be best served by the creation of a lien.\nLiens can further be classi\ufb01ed as general or speci\ufb01c and voluntary or involuntary.\nGeneral liens affect all property, both real and personal. Speci\ufb01c liens affect only one\nspeci\ufb01c property. Voluntary liens are created by voluntary actions of the individual. In-\nvoluntary liens are created by law, without action or consent of the individual, such as\nthe govemment's right to tax real property. Involuntary liens are on a speci\ufb01c property\nand take precedence over all other liens and encumbrances.\nArizona uses a single tax bill. The tax bill combines state, county, municipal,\nschool, and other district levies into a single statement for payment to the county trea-\nsurer. This property tax is caled an ad valorem tax. Every January a Notice of Valuation\nis mailed that shows the full cash value, the limited value, and the assessed value for\neach property. The full cash value is the most probable price that property would\nbring in a competitive and open market. The limited value is calculated through a\nChapter 8 \u2022 Encumbrances\n9 9\nformula set by law, which restricts how much the limited value may increase in any one\nyear. A taxpayer who feels that the full cash value is too high may make an appeal to the\ncounty assessor. A taxpayer can also appeal the classi\ufb01cation of the property\nyear's tax is due on October 1 and is delinquent on November 1. The second half of the\ntax is due on March 1 of the next year and is delinquent on May 1. A penalty of 16 percent\nper annum or 1.33 percent per month will be imposed against all delinquent taxes. A\ndelinquent notice is mailed to the taxpayer in September. If the delinquent taxes are\nnot paid after receiving this notice, the tax lien will be sold for taxes in February.\nThe treasurer mails a notice of sale of property to the taxpayer. At the treasurer's\nsale, the purchaser of the tax lien receives a Certi\ufb01cate of Purchase. The successful bid-\nder has to pay the back taxes and interest and also will have to pay taxes during the own-\ner's redemption period. During the owner's right of redemption, the owner has 3 years\nfrom the date of sale to redeem the property. To redeem the property, the owner must pay\nall of the past due taxes, penalties, interest, and transfer fees. To obtain ownership of the\nproperty, the Certi\ufb01cate of Purchase holder brings an action in superior court.\ncurbs, sidewalks, streets, sewers, and streetlights. Payment for the special assessment\nmay be made in one lump sum or paid in installments. Property may be sold for unpaid\nspecial assessment liens.\nThe priority of the lien dates back to the beginning date of work by the general contractor.\nA judgment is the result of a court action in which one person brings a suit against\nanother person. Judgments are granted for a S-year period and can be renewed for S-year\nperiods. If a debtor does not satisfy the judgment, Arizona statutes provide for a writ of\nexecution to attach one's property and sell it to satisfy the debt. There are two types of\nexecution: general execution and special execution. A general execution commands the\nof\ufb01cer to take the amount of the judgment out of property of the judgment debtor with-\nout specifying the particular property. A special execution commands the of\ufb01cer to sell\ncertain speci\ufb01c property or to deliver certain speci\ufb01c real or personal property to the\nentitled party.\nA writ of attachment is the legal process of seizing the real or personal property of a\ndefendant in a lawsuit and holding it in the custody of the court as security for satisfac-\ntion of a judgment. A writ of attachment is usually \ufb01led prior to the court action for judg-\nment so that the property could not be sold before the court has acted.\nLis pendens is a recorded legal document that gives constructive notice that an\naction affecting a particular piece of property has been \ufb01led in a state or federal court.\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nencumbrance\n20-day notice\ndeed restriction\na d valorem tax\ndominant tenement\nappurtenant easement\neasement\nassessed value\neasement in gross\nCerti\ufb01cate of Purchase\negress\nCovenants, Conditions, and\nencroachment\nRestrictions (CC&Rs)\n",

Home ownership also improves a person's credit\nrating.\n\u2022 Psychologically, a person who buys a house will usualy feel pride of ownership;\ntherefore, he or she will usualy take more pride in its care and maintenance than\na renter.\n\u2022 Interest in community affairs. When a person becomes a homeowner, that person\ntends to become interested in what happens to his or her tax dollars or in what is being\ndone to resolve current community issues.\n\u2022 Homeowners have the independence and freedom to use the property as they\nwish within the framework of the law. They are also free from landlord\nrestrictions.\n\u2022 Creative opportunities. Homeowners are free to develop their property in accord-\nance with zoning and deed restrictions. The homeowner may remodel and\ndecorate according to his or her artistic and cultural preferences. The renter must\ntake the home or apartment as-is and adjust to its limitations.\n\u2022 Tax bene\ufb01ts. Real property taxes and interest on a mortgage or trust deed are\nallowable deductions on one's annual income tax retum. Gains of up to $250,000\nor S$00,000 on the sale of a quali\ufb01ed primary residence are exempt from income\ntax. Tax bene\ufb01ts related to home ownership are covered in Chapter 28.\nBene\ufb01ts of Renting\n\u2022 Mobility, If a person must move from city to city because of his or her job, i t is\noften better to rent than to buy. This also applies if employment is seasonal and one\nhas to move according to the seasons.\n\u2022 If a person wishes to be free from the maintenance and management of property,\nrenting may be more ideal.\n\u2022 Financial reasons. If a person cannot afford the necessary down payment or needs to\nuse his or her funds for other purposes, renting may be the better option. In order\nto make home ownership \ufb01nancialy advantageous, one must generally own the\nproperty for more than 3 years. The \ufb01rst years of ownership are usually more costly\nt h a n   r e n t i n g .\nTypes of Housing\nAs the United States has moved to a more urban population, a greater variety of housing\ntypes has become necessary. Affordable housing has also become an important issue as\nprices for single-family homes continue to increase. Today, people can choose to rent or\nown the following types of housing:\n\u2022 Single-family residence\n\u2022 Patio homes and town homes, usualy within a master planned community\n\u2022 Duplex up to a fourplex\n\u2022 Apartment complex\n\u2022 High-rise residential complex\n\u2022 Mobile home or manufactured housing\nChapter 9 \u2022 Home Ownership and Home Construction\n1 0 5\nPROPERTY INSURANCE\nInsurance is a contractual agreement used to spread the risk of \ufb01nancial loss among a\nlarge group. Through the purchase of an insurance policy, a property owner shares\nthe risk of property loss due to various events. The risk of property loss is shared\nwith others insured by the same company and reduces the likelihood of disastrous \ufb01nan-\ncial consequences.\nSome common types of property insurance include dweling insurance, homeown-\ners' insurance, commercial property insurance, and federal \ufb02ood insurance.\nDwelling Insurance\nDweling insurance is for residential properties, including single-family homes, one-\nto four-family houses, duplexes, triplexes, and permanently installed mobile homes.\nA standard dwelling property policy covers losses from \ufb01re, lightning, and internal\nexplosion. Additional perils can be covered through the purchase of an extended\npolicy.\nHomeowners' Insurance\nHomeowners' insurance policies are known as multiline policies, which means that\nthey combine property and casualty coverage in the same policy. The advantage of a\nmultiline policy is that several coverages related to a speci\ufb01c type of exposure are\npackaged together, which reduces the number of insurance policies to be purchased.\nThe package policy provides the same property coverage that is available in a dwell-\ning insurance policy and also includes theft insurance and personal liability coverage.\nLiability includes personal injuries and expenses sustained by guests or resident\nemployees. It also includes any damage that the homeowner may cause to the prop-\nerty o f others.\nCommercial Property Insurance\nCommercial property insurance is used to cover most types of commercial buildings.\nGenerally, the basic causes of loss that are covered by the commercial property policy\nare \ufb01re, lightning, explosion, windstorm or hail, smoke, aircraft or vehicles, riot or civil\ncommotion, vandalism, accidental sprinkler leakage, sinkhole collapse, and volcanic\naction. Extending the coverage with special endorsements can also cover additional\nperils.\nCoinsurance Clause\nCommercial insurance often includes a coinsurance clause that requires the policy\nowner to insure at least 80 percent of the value of the property in exchange for a pre-\nmium discount. If the insured's policy contains this clause and the insured carries less\nthan this amount, a penalty will occur in case of a partial loss. In periods of high in\ufb02a-\ntion, it is very important for the property owner to keep track of the property's current\nvalue in order to maintain this 80 percent coverage.\nFor example, if a person insures a commercial property with an actual market\nvalue of $100,000 with a policy containing an 80 percent coinsurance clause, the in-\nsurance required is $80,000 (80 percent of $100,000). If the insured carried only\n$60,000 of insurance and there was a loss of $40,000, the insurance policy would\ncover only $30,000 of the loss. The amount covered is a fraction of the loss, with\nthe amount of insurance as the numerator and the required insurance as the denomi-\nnator. (In the example, S60,000/S80,000 converts to 75 percent, and 75 percent of\n$40,000 equals $30,000.)\n",

The program provides aid to victims of\ndisastrous hooding. Floods cause more property damage in the United States than\nany other form of natural disaster.\nThere are four situations covered by this insurance:\n1. Over\ufb02ow of inland or tidal waters\n2. Runoff of surface waters\n3. Mudslides\n4. Abnormal crosion caused by \ufb02oods\nInforming the Buyer\nThe program is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nFlood insurance is mandatory on \ufb02oodplain properties that the federal govemment \ufb01nan-\nces, insures, or guarantees.\nA broker is responsible for informing the buyer of the \ufb02ood insurance requirement\nwhen negotiating the sale. Many areas in Arizona are in a \ufb02oodplain, which means the\nlender will require the buyer to acquire \ufb02ood insurance. The local broker's of\ufb01ce should\nhave a map showing the local \ufb02oodplain areas.\nThe \ufb02ood insurance policy may be purchased through any private insurance agency.\nInsurance Underwriting\nInsurance underwriting is the process used by the insurance company to ascertain the\ntypes of risks it will accept through the issuance of an insurance policy. This includes an\nevaluation of the property and the individual or entity applying for the insurance. Under-\nwriters use credit reports and CLUE reports to evaluate risks.\nCredit Reports\nWhen an applicant applies for insurance, the insurance underwriter often orders some\ntype of credit report to obtain information conceming the personal habits or \ufb01nancial\ncondition of the potential insured. Credit reports are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting\nAct, and if an applicant is rejected because of information contained in the report, the\napplicant can request the name of the reporting agency and contact it directly.\nCLUE Reports\nCLUE stands for the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, which was formed\nby the insurance industry in order to better control its losses. CLUE established a na-\ntional database on claims and inquiries. Almost all large insurance companies and\nmost of the smaller ones are members. Every time an insurance agent is contacted\nabout a claim or any inquiry, it is noted on the Exchange.\nBuyers with two or more inquiries or claims during the prior 3 years may not be\ninsurable at all or might not be insurable with a major insurance company. This\nmeans that buyers would have to obtain higher-premium coverage from a smaller\nc o m p a n y.\nAn inquiry is any call to the insurance agent about an actual or potential loss\nthat would be covered by a homeowner's policy. This also applies to the property\nbeing purchased. If the sellers have \ufb01led two or more claims or made two or more\ninquiries, the major insurance companies may not be willing to insure the property.\nhigher premium.\nThe buyers will be forced to turn to the smaller insurance company and to pay a\nChapter 9 \u2022 Home Ownership and Home Construction\n1 0 7\nOnly the seller's insurance agent can obtain a CLUE report. Real estate agents\nshould make sure that the CLUE report is obtained during the inspection period so\nthat the buyer's insurance company can determine if the property being purchased is in-\nsurable at a premium acceptable to the buyer.\nHOME WARRANTY\nAs protection against the cost of repairs, the home seller or buyer frequently purchases a\nhome warranty contract after the close of escrow. Items usually covered in a home\nwarranty contract include the following:\n\u2022 Plumbing\n\u2022 Plumbing stoppages\n\u2022 Water heaters\n\u2022 Ductwork\n\u2022 Electrical\n\u2022 Kitchen appliances\n\u2022 Attic and exhaust fans\n\u2022 Ceiling fans\n\u2022 Central air-conditioning\nOptional coverage is also generally available for the following:\n\u2022 Pool and spa equipment\n\u2022 Clothes washer and dryer\n\u2022 Kitchen refrigerator\n\u2022 Well pump\n\u2022 Limited roof leak coverage\n\u2022 Septic tank pumping\nMost contracts cover the cost of repairs to the items covered if the item was in good, safe\nworking order at the start of coverage. The contracts also generally provide coverage for\nunknown defects if the defect or malfunction would not have been detectable to the\nbuyer, seller, or agent through visual inspection or simple mechanical test.\nHOME CONSTRUCTION\nThere are many different styles, materials, and \ufb01nishes used in residential home con-\nstruction. A basic understanding of construction is vital for those involved in real estate\nsales. Different methods of construction are used in the eastern and northem United\nStates with their colder climates, as opposed to the South's dampness and the Southwest\ndesert's extreme heat. Wood frame construction is the most frequently used in building\nsingle-family houses. Because of its cost, block construction is no longer the standard\nmaterial used in Arizona. Wood frame is less expensive, easier to heat and cool, and\noffers a variety of architectural styles.\nHouse Styles\nA ranch-style house is far less costly to construct than a \"U\" - or \"H\"-shaped building.\nWhile all three styles have the same livable square feet, the U and H shape could be\nmore costly to construct, heat, and cool due to the greater amount of outside surface\nHowever, the U and H house shapes do offer more possibilities for interesting architectural\ndesigns.\n",

A split-\nlevel house has one-and-a-half stories with limited attic and basement space. A two-\nstory house has the same living space on both levels. A two-story house can be more\neconomical because the plumbing on each \ufb02oor can be lined up, and because heat\nrises, it is casier to heat. A split-level house will have a basement a half-level below\nground level and a second story a hal\ufb02evel above ground level; this style allows a larger\nhome to be built in a smaller amount of space.\nArchitectural styles vary depending on the area of the country. In Arizona, ranch, con-\ntemporary, Spanish, and temitorial styles are more popular than English Tudor or Southem\nColonial. Some styles are not really adaptable to smaller homes, such as a traditional\nFrench Provincial or Victorian.

Wals are most often constructed on the \ufb02oor in sections, consisting of the\nmudsill, studding, and top plate, and then they are raised to the upright position and\nsecured in place.

Sheathing is 4 feet by 8 feet plywood or other wood exterior covering\nplaced over exterior studding. Some less expensive houses use only tarpaper and\nchicken wire.\nStucco is one of the most common materials used because it is \ufb02exible and inex-\npensive. Other \ufb01nishes include brick, stone, or composition board. Brick is usually\nonly a veneer and does not give support, but it does make a durable and desirable \ufb01nish.\nHowever, brick can be used in a double-brick wall or with block backup to form the\nactual support for the \ufb02oors and roof, as used in many commercial and industrial build-\nings and in older homes.\nA wide variety of roo\ufb02ines, such as hip, gable, and shed, are popular in the south-\nwester desert of Arizona, whereas the \"A\" frame is more widely used in northern\nArizona.

Insulation in the walls and ceiling is all rated by the R factor. According to the\nNational Association of Homebuilders, a thickness of 4 inches of blanket \ufb01berglass or\nrock wool is classi\ufb01ed as RII and is equal to 9 inches of lumber or 4 feet of block in\nits ability to resist heat transfer. Rating on ceilings should be R19, and \ufb02oors and walls\nshould be RIl. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department of\nVeterans' Affairs (DVA) require 6 inches in the ceiling and 3 1/2 inches in the\nwalls of newly constructed houses.\nInsulation materials include \ufb01berglass, rock wool, batts or blown wool, cellulose,\npoured venniculite, Cellotex or insulating boards, and Styrofoam.\nInterior Walls and Ceilings\nDrywall, Sheetrock, plasterboard, or gypsum board are the materials most commonly\nused to replace lath and plaster to \ufb01nish ceilings and walls. Sheetrock is nailed over\nthe studs after the insulation has been installed. The seams are butted, mudded, taped,\nand troweled or sprayed to give the effect of plaster. Ceilings are sometimes sprayed\nwith an acoustical material to absorb sound. Although higher ceilings have become\nvery popular, the standard ceiling height is still considered 8 feet.\nHeating and Air-Conditioning\nCentral warm-air heating is found in most houses built today. The system consists of\nwarm air forced through ducts in the ceilings and returned by ducts that intake and recir-\nculate the air. The heating capacity of the fumace is measured in BTUs (British Thermal\nUnits) per hour. A BTU is enough heat to raise I pound of water 1\u00ba Fahrenheit. The size\nof the unit required is determined by calculating the cubic feet to be warmed and taking\ninto account the quality of construction, insulation, windows, and doors.\nAir-conditioning units are rated either by BUs per hour or by tons. A ton of air-con-\nditioning is equal to 12,000 BTUs per hour, which is equivalent to the amount of cooling\nyou would get from melting one ton of ice in 24 hours. Like heating units, the size of a\nunit will depend upon the total cubic feet to be cooled, the quality of construction, and the\nwindow placement in relation to the movement of the sun. A rule-of-thumb \ufb01gure would\nbe about 3200 cubic feet for each ton of equipment for a residence.\nHeat Pump\nThe heat pump is a popular and effective system that uses a natural fumace for heating and\nmay replace an air-conditioning unit. The heat pump is basically a refrigeration unit that\nreverses the \ufb02ow of refrigerant so that it can heat as well as cool. It uses electrical energy\nto move heat from a cooler to a warmer location. This is much more economical than con-\nverting electrical enengy to heat, which is expensive but cleaner than gas or oil fumaces.\nWindows and Doors\nHouses in Arizona most often utilize sliding windows. Other types available are case-\nment or pivot, which swing or crank out, and double hung, with moveable sashes\nthat raise or lower vertically. The sliding window usually has a frame made of aluminum\nand is the least expensive. Window glass varies in thickness and quality. The quality can\nbe judged by its clarity of view,\nChapter 9 \u2022 Home Ownership and Home Construction\nExterior doors are usually of metal or solid wood 1 3/4 inches thick. Interior doors\nare usually 1 3/8 inches thick. Flush exterior doors can be hollow-core doors, that is, a\nwood frame with a wood or molded composition veneer forming a \ufb02ush or panel door.\nInterior Layout\nMost houses have separate zones or areas for living, sleeping, and working. The work or\nkitchen area should be convenient to the dining, storage, and parking areas for easy\ntransport of groceries. A well-designed kitchen will have adequate lighting, storage,\nand ample work surfaces.\nThe living area should be near the front door. Its placement should be away from the\nSleeping areas and closer to the dining room for more comfortable entertainment. If there\nis no family room, the living or great room should have the best views. The family room,\na more active area, is usually away from the sleeping areas and closer to the kitchen for\neasier access and serving of meals.\nThe sleeping zone should be farthest away from active living areas and on the cool\nside of the house. Some popular designs feature a split bedroom plan, with the master\nbedroom on one side and the smaller bedrooms on the other, each with its own bath.\nAs a general rule, one bath for each two adults and one for each three children is prac-\ntical. If a house is more than one level, a toilet and lavatory should be on each level\nNormally, a bath will require at least 35 square feet of space, but the recent trend is to-\nward much larger bathrooms.\nStorage Space\nBecause most houses in Arizona do not have a basement for storage, ample closet, ga-\nrage, or storage space is necessary. A utility area will also have connections for a washer\nand dryer whereas a storage area, usually at the end of a carport, does not. The garage\nshould be placed on the south or west side to absorb the sun and protect the living areas.\nIt should also be close to the kitchen but not block out light to other rooms. A garage\nshould be at least 23 feet deep.\nAlthough you will not be tested on landscaping, a person selling real estate should\nhave a good understanding of the types of grasses and trees grown in the different\nregions of Arzona, as well as a general knowledge of when \ufb02owers bloom and citrus\nripens. A trip to the nursery will be a great help to you in the world of selling real estate.\nContractor Requirements\nIn Arizona, all contractors who perform residential and commercial remodeling and con-\nstruction must be licensed and bonded. However, this requirement does not apply to\nwork costing less than $750 (including material and labor) if there is no building permit\nrequired and the work is not part of a larger project.\nContractors are licensed in order to protect the consumer. The Registrar of Contrac-\ntors can order licensed contractors t o correct defective work, but n o similar recourse\nexists against unlicensed contractors who fall outside the jurisdiction of the Registrar.\nLicense Requirements'\nTo obtain a license, contractors must pass a business management test and sometimes a\ntrade test, depending on the type of construction performed. In the application, contrac-\ntors must list their work history and experience. Many license classi\ufb01cations also require\na speci\ufb01ed length of experience. Contracting without a license is punishable by up to\na $2,500 \ufb01ne and 6 months in jail. A second offense within 2 years is punishable by\n18 months in jail and up to a S150,000 \ufb01ne.\nInformation on licensing requirements taken from Arizona Registrar of Contractors website: http://www.azroc.gov\n113\n",

Quality builders typically provide a 1-year warranty on a new home and its\ncomponents and remain responsible for any structural defects for 2 years. Any defects\nfound in appliances and plumbing and electrical \ufb01xtures that were property installed\nby the contractor are usually limited to the manufacturer's warranty.\nThe effective date for the start of coverage generally begins when the buyer occu-\npies the structure or the date of discovery, whichever occurs \ufb01rst.\nThe Registrar of Contractors has jurisdiction over a contractor's workmanship. The\nRegistrar of Contractors cannot award monetary damages but in certain cases may sus-\npend or revoke a contractor's license.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nIn the United States, the percentage of people who own homes continues to increase\nbecause of goverment policies that encourage ownership and because of the signi\ufb01-\ncant bene\ufb01ts of home ownership, including establishing \ufb01nancial stability, ful\ufb01lling\na deep longing for ownership, and tax bene\ufb01ts. However, there are bene\ufb01ts to renting\nas well, including mobility and freedom from management and maintenance.\nSome common types of property insurance include dwelling insurance, homeown-\ners' insurance, commercial property insurance, and federal \ufb02ood insurance. Dwelling in-\nsurance is for residential properties, and a standard policy covers losses from \ufb01re,\nlightning, and internal explosion. Homeowners' insurance policies are multiline policies,\nwhich means that they combine property and casualty coverage in the same policy. The\npackage policy provides the same property coverage that is available in a dwelling in-\nsurance policy and also includes theft insurance and personal liability coverage. The\nbasic causes of loss that are covered by a commercial property policy are listed in the\ntext. Federal \ufb02ood insurance, a federally subsidized program, is mandatory on \ufb02oodplain\nproperties with mortgages that the federal govemment \ufb01nances, insures, or guarantees.\nA broker is responsible for informing the buyer of the \ufb02ood insurance requirement when\nnegotiating the sale.\nInsurance underwriting is used by insurance companies to ascertain the types\nof risks they will accept through the issuance of an insurance policy. Two reports\nthat an insurance underwriter uses to evaluate risks are credit reports and CLUE\nreports.\nThe home seller or buyer, as protection against the cost of repairs, frequently pur-\nchases a home warranty contract after the close of escrow. Most contracts cover the cost\nof repairs to the items covered if the item was in good, safe, working order at the start of\ncoverage. The contracts also generally provide coverage for unknown defects if the\ndefect or malfunction would not have been detectable to the buyer, seller, or agent\nthrough visual inspection or simple mechanical test.\nMany different styles, materials, and \ufb01nishes are used in residential home con-\nstruction. Some basic house styles are the ranch, Cape Cod, split-level, and two-\nstory. In Arizona, ranch, contemporary, Spanish, and territorial styles are more pop-\nular than English Tudor or Southern Colonial. The foundation is the substructure\nfor the superstructure itself. The foundation includes the footings, foundation walls,\ncolumns, and pedestals. Most residences in Arizona are built on a concrete slab.\nWood frame construction, which is less expensive, easier to heat and cool, and offers\na variety of architectural styles, is the most frequently used in building single-family\nhouses. Stucco is one of the most common materials used to cover the exterior walls\nbecause it is \ufb02exible and inexpensive.\nThe R factor rates all insulation in the walls and ceiling. Insulation materials include\n\ufb01berglass, rock wool, batts or blown wool, cellulose, poured vermiculite, Cellotex or\nChapter 9 \u2022 Home Ownership and Home Construction\ninsulating boards, and Styrofoam.

Fee simple on condition subsequent\n3. Fee simple conditional\nQuali\ufb01ed fees are said to be defeasible, which means they can be terminated if certain\nconditions are met or not met.\nFee simple determinable is subject to a certain restriction that is included in the\ndeed. For example, a fee simple determinable estate could be granted to a church with\nthe words, \"as long as it is used as a church.\" The limiting language (for example,\n\"for so long as,\" \"while,\" or \"during the period\"\") speaks in terms of duration. In\nother words, the estate is vested in the grantee until such time as the restriction is\nnot observed. In the previous example, in the event the building and land are no\nlonger used as a church, the property will automatically revert to the grantor or\nthe grantor's heirs without any action on their part. The grantor of a fee simple deter-\nminable retains a possibility of reverter, meaning a right to retake possession of\nthe land.\nFee simple on condition subsequent places conditions on the grantee. For exam-\nple, a fee simple on condition subsequent estate could grant property to a person with the\nwords, \"provided that you do not smoke on the property.\" The limiting language (for\nexample, \"provided that,\" \"on the condition that,\" or \"if\") speaks in terms of an\nevent or a speci\ufb01c condition. In this example, if the condition is violated, the grantor\nor his or her heirs have a right to regain ownership. However, the property does not re-\nvert to the grantor (or heirs) automatically. To get the property back, the grantor must\ntake action, which may include court action. The grantor of a fee simple on condition\nsubsequent retains a possibility of reverter and right of reentry (that is, a right to reenter\nupon the land and retake possession).\nIn both fee simple determinable and fee simple on condition subsequent instances,\nthe grantor retains a possibility of reverter, which means that title to the property may, at\nsome future date, revert to the grantor. For fee simple determinable, title will revert to the\ngrantor automatically; for a fee simple on condition subsequent, the grantor (or grantor's\nquire legal action.\ncondition subsequent, use these guidelines:\n\u2022 Usually fee simple determinable states a use limitation, which is usually stated in a\npositive manner, for example, \"as long as used as a school.\"\n\u2022 A fee simple on condition subsequent is usually stated in a negative manner, and\nalcohol or use drugs.\nis frequently a personal condition, for example, \"as long as you do not drink\nFee simple conditional, also known as fee tail, is a fee simple with a restriction to the\nright of inheritance, such as limiting the right of inheritance to a \ufb01xed line of succes-\nsion, such as \"to the \ufb01rst-bom son in each generation.\" Fee simple conditional is not\nlegal in Arizona.\nLife Estates\nLife estates are divided into two classi\ufb01cations: conventional life estates and legal life\ndeeds life estate to\nChapter 10 \u2022 Freehold Estates and How Property Is Held\n121\nFIGURE 10.2\nEstate in Reversion\nreverts b a c k\nt o A\nupon death\no f B\nEstate i n Reversion\nConventional Life Estates\nConventional life estates are not inheritable. A conventional life estate is a fee simple\nestate granted for the life of an individual. The estate is terminated upon the individual's\ndeath. A property owner uses a deed that names the life tenant and speci\ufb01es who will\nreceive the property at the death of the life tenant.\nThe person or organization that is to receive the property after the death of the life\ntenant has a future interest in the property. There are three variations of life tenancies,\neach with a difference in the future interest. They are known as:\nEstate in reversion. The grantor speci\ufb01es by reservation in the deed that the prop-\nerty will be returned to the grantor or his or her heirs at the time of the life tenant's\ndeath. In Figure 10.2, A deeds a life estate to B for B's life with the provision that\nwhen B dies the title reverts to 1. B holds a life estate; A holds the estate in\nreversion.\nEstate in remainder. The grantor states in the deed that upon the death of the life\ntenant, the property will go to a third person. The third person with the remainder\ninterest is known as the remainderman. In Figure 10.3, 4 deeds a life estate to B for\nthe life of B. When B dies, the property passes to C. B holds the life estate; C holds\nthe estate in remainder.\nEstate pur autre vie (taken from French, meaning \"for the life of another\"). In this\ncase, the grantor names a life tenant, but the estate is based on the life of a person\nother than the life tenant. At the death of the third person, the estate reverts to either\nthe grantor or to a remainderman, whomever the grantor has speci\ufb01ed in the deed.\nAn estate pur autre vie can be willed by the life tenant, but the estate is still limited\nby the life of the third person.\nFor as long as he or she lives, a life tenant has all the privileges of ownership. A life\ntenant can use the property or receive any income from the property. A life tenant can\nalso mortgage, sell, or lease the property; however, because the estate is valid only for\nthe life tenant's lifetime, it would be dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd an interested buyer or tenant. A\nlender might be willing to make a loan on the property, provided that a life insurance\npolicy in the amount of the loan was issued, with the lender named as the bene\ufb01ciary.\nd e e d s life\ne s t a t e t o\nFIGURE 10.3\nEstate i n Remainder\nupon death\no f B\nC (remainder person)\nEstate in Remainder\n",

Dower and cur-\ntesy have been enacted as law in 1 states, with a homestead law in effect in 43 states. In\nArizona, homestead is the only legal life estate. Dower and curtesy are not necessary in\nArizona because of the state's community property laws.\nDower rights come from old English law, wherein any property bought during mar-\nriage belongs to the husband, but husband and wife share the use of the property. The\nwife is said to have inchoate (incomplete) rights in the property until the death of her\nhusband. At her husband's death, she has a life tenant's estate.\nCurtesy rights are just the reverse of dower rights. Curtesy gives the husband rights\nto his wife's freehold estate upon her death, in the form of a life estate, provided she\nowned an estate of inheritance during marriage, and that she also gave birth to children\nwho could inherit the life estate at the death of her spouse. Curtesy rights are also incho-\nate rights, which do not take effect until the death of the wife.\nHomestead means that a person's primary residence or homestead is exempt from\nattachment, execution, and forced sale from creditors. We will review the homestead ex-\nemption in more detail in the next section.\nHOMESTEAD EXEMPTION\nHomestead is the only legal life estate in Arizona created by statute. What the homestead\nlaw really means is that a person's primary residence or homestead is exempt from\nattachment, execution, and forced sale from creditors. The equity in an owner's primary\nresidence is protected up to $150,000.\nThe homestead exemption law automatically exempts the homestead of any per-\nson 18 years of age or over, married or single, who resides in the state and is the head\nof the household. The law protects the principal residence, such as a single-family\nhouse, a condominium or townhouse, a mobile home in a park, or a mobile home\non one's own land. In the latter case, both are protected-the mobile home and the\nland. The exemption is automatic\u2014it attaches to the homestead property automatically\nand the owner is not required to \ufb01le any type of document to claim or perfect the\nhomestead exemption.\nA marred couple or a single person may protect only one homestead. If the home\nwhere they both lived as a married couple is claimed as a homestead after they are\ndivorced, the total exemption could not exceed $150,000. If a homestead is claimed be-\nfore the time of a voluntary or involuntary sale of the property, the cash proceeds from\nthe sale are protected by the homestead law for 18 months or until a new homestead is\nacquired, whichever is sooner.\nUnder Anizona homestead lew, a maried couple may claim the homestead, but both\nspouses must claim the homestead in community or joint property. If a claimant is mar-\nlect sole and separate property.\nried, the homestead exemption may protect community or joint property, or it may pro-\nThe homestead exemption protects the primary residence from process and from\nsale under judgment or lien, except for the following:\n1. A consensual lien, including a mortgage or trust deed\n2. A mechanic's lien for labor or material\n3. A judgment or other lien exceeding SI50,000 that may be satis\ufb01ed from the equity of\nthe debtor\nChapter 10 \u2022 Freehold Estates and How Property Is Held\n1 2 3\nHomestead Exemption Removal\nA homestead may be removed from the property in a number of ways, including a sale\nor transfer by deed, moving out of Arizona, or abandonment. The law considers an ab-\nsence of 2 years, even without the \ufb01ling of any document, as abandonment.\nHOW PROPERTY IS HELD\nOne or more persons may hold property. When one person holds property, it is held in\nseveralty. When two or more persons hold property, the tenancy is called concurrent\nownership, also known as co-ownership. Remember, tenancy means the estate of a ten-\nant, whether in-fee, for life, for years, at will, or othenise.\nSeveralty\nSeveralty is taking title as sole owner, either as a natural person or a legal person. A\nnatural person means an individual person, whereas a legal person means a legal entity.\nsuch as a corporation, an association, or an organization.\nAll govemment-owned property, such as streets, buildings, and parks, is owned in\nseveralty. It is owned by the govemment entity that has jurisdiction over it, such as mu-\nnicipal, county, state, or federal govemment.\nConcurrent Ownership\nConcurrent ownership, or co-ownership, is a form of ownership in which two or more\npersons have an undivided interest in the same land. For example, a number of people\ncould each own a fraction of land but share with others a single right of possession.\nA number of legal problems can arise from ownership that is too complex. Some of\nthe forms of ownership that were derived from common law are now being replaced\nwith partnerships, corporations, or trusts.\nFORMS OF CONCURRENT OWNERSHIP\nThere are \ufb01ve basic forms of concurrent ownership:\n1. Tenants in common\n2. Joint tenancy\n3. Community property\n4. Community property with rights of survivorship\n5. Tenancy by the entirety\nTenants i n Common\nTenants in common is probably the most widely used form of ownership between mul-\ntiple parties. In Arizona, if two single people do not address how they choose to take\ntitle, they will automatically become tenants in common. In this form of ownership,\neach owner or part owner has an undivided interest and rights of possession of the entire\nparcel. These undivided rights exist even though there may be unequal shares.\nFor example, if \ufb01ve people owned an acre of ground and one person paid for half of\nthe land and the other four paid for the other half, they still have equal rights of possession.\nEach person will receive a deed-one for an undivided half-interest and the others each\nwith an undivided 1/8-interest. Each person has the right to sell, encumber, or will his or\nher interest in the land. If one of the \ufb01ve owners died, his or her share of the ownership\nwould pass by will or by descent, and the rest of the owners' rights would not be affected.\n",

In that situation, it is possible to appeal to the courts to divide the ownership.\nThis is referred to as a partition action, which means \"to divide.\"\nJoint Tenancy\nJoint tenancy is also caled joint tenancy with the right of survivorship (JTWRS). In\nthis type of ownership, in the case of death, the survivor automaticaly acquires ownership\nof the property. If there are ten owners and one dies, nine owners now share that interest.\nThere are four common-law unities that must be present to create JTWRS:\n1. Possession-Equal rights for all.\n2. Interest-Each has equal percent of ownership.\n3. Title-There is only one deed; all owners take title under one deed.\n4. Time-It must be created at the same time.\nThese four common-law unities are often referred to as \"PITT.\"\nThe distinguishing characteristic of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship, which\nmakes the ownership interest not inheritable. Ownership interest cannot be willed\nbecause it ceases with death. This type of ownership is sometimes referred to as a\n\"poor man's will\" because taking title as JTWRS eliminates the need to probate. The\n\ufb01ling of an estate tax waiver and a copy of the death certi\ufb01cate will suf\ufb01ce.\nDeeds to JTWRS must be signed by all grantees to acknowledge that they are in fact\ncreating a tenancy that allows their interest to pass to the survivor.\nA joint tenant can sell his or her interest or deed it away without the consent of the\nother owner or owners. This action breaks the tenancy and establishes a new tenancy\ndepending on the number of owners.\nIf three people bought a building and took title as JTWRS and one sold his or her\ninterest, the two remaining would still have JTWRS along with the new owner as tenants\nin common. Because one of the unities (time) is missing, the new owner cannot have a\nJTWRS. It could be created again by deeding the property to a straw person who would\nthen deed it back on one deed at one time. A straw person is an individual or entity,\nsuch as an escrow company, that brie\ufb02y holds title to the real estate and then transfers\nthe interest at one time to the owners that now include the new owner. This allows the\nunity of time to be met and, therefore, the old joint tenant owners and the new owner can\nhold the property together as joint tenants.\nIf owners who hold title as JTWRS sell a property and carry back the equity in the\nform of a note and trust deed, unless it states in the note and trust deed that they wish to\nhold title to the paper as JTWRS, it will become either community property, if they are\nmarried, or tenants in common, if they are not.\nCommunity Property\nArizona is one of eight states that have enacted community property laws. The other\nstates are Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Califomia, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.\nThe origin of the community property is in Spanish law and is used in the western\nUnited States because of the 1848 treaty signed at Guadalupe Hidalgo. The Spanish\nlaw is based on the theory that in marriage the husband and wife are equals, rather\nthan marriage being a combination of the husband and wife into one entity.\nEach spouse has ownership of half of the marital property (both real and personal),\nincluding wages acquired subsequent to marriage. Because of this law, neither dower\nnor curtesy rights are recognized in Arizona. For married couples in Arizona, title is\nautomatically taken as community property, unless speci\ufb01cally stated otherwise in\nt h e deed.\nChapter 10 \u2022 Freehold Estates and How Property Is Held\nAll community property is used and liable for the debts of either spouse, no matter who\ncreated the debts. Each spouse is also liable for the separate debts of a spouse up to his or\nher share of the community property. Both spouses have equal authority to manage, control,\nor dispose of al community property. Except for real property, each spouse can create debt,\nbut the total assets of the marital community can be claimed for payment of the debt.\nEach spouse is free to will his or her half of the community estate. Upon the death\nof one of the spouses, one half of the property belongs to the survivor. If there is no will\nand no children of that marriage, the other half goes to the survivor. If there are heirs and\nno will, the property will pass by the laws of intestate succession descent. Intestate suc-\ncession means that the decedent did not have a will. The laws of intestate succession,\nwhich will be covered in Chapter 16, are the statutes that identify which heirs of the\ndecedent are to inherit the estate when there is no will.\nIn community property ownership, one spouse can purchase property without the\nconsent of the other. However, one spouse may not sell, encumber, or convey property\nwithout the consent of the other spouse. An easy way to remember this is, \"It takes one\nto buy and two to sell.\" Both spouses' signatures are required to convey. This is a very\nimportant aspect for the prospective licensee, because it affects many of the documents\ninvolving the selling of real estate.\nSeparate property brought into the marriage by one of the spouses remains that\nspouse's separate property. These items, real or personal, stocks, bonds, money, and\nautomobiles should not be commingled with the community property. Money and real\nproperty inherited or received as a gift after the marriage remain the separate property\nof the devisee. One must be careful to keep separate accounts of separate property so\nit does not become part of the community property.\nCommunity Property with Rights of Survivorship\nCommunity property with rights of survivorship (CPWROS) was created by the\nArizona legislature in 1994 and 1995. Its objective is to allow a married couple t o\nreceive bene\ufb01ts under the federal tax code for community property while avoiding\nprobate. A husband and wife may take title to property as CPWROS when the\ndeed expressly states the right of survivorship is desired. The four common-law uni-\nties (possession, interest, title, and time) required to create a joint tenancy are not\nrequired when taking title as CPWROS. The legislature speci\ufb01cally states that the\nhusband and wife may create community property with right of survivorship by ei-\nther deeding to themselves or, when one of them already has title, deeding to him\n(her) self and the spouse. Straw party deeds are not necessary to create CPWROS.\nThe statute also provides that either spouse may terminate the effect of right of sur-\nvivorship provision by recording an af\ufb01davit. Furthermore, divorce or annulment\nterminates the right of survivorship.\nTenancy by the Entirety\nTenancy by the entirety is a type of ownership existing only between husband and\nwife. This type of co-ownership is based upon the common law that regarded a husband\nand wife as a single legal person. One result was that if the spouses acquired equal inter-\nests in real estate by the same instrument, the property was considered owned as an in-\ndivisible legal unit. Upon the death of either, the survivor remained as the parcel's sole\nowner. Modem law has long accepted this result.\nToday, a right of survivorship similar to that existing for the joint tenancy exists for\nthe tenancy by the entirety. In a small estate, this right bene\ufb01ts the surviving spouse be-\ncause it avoids probate proceedings. A tenancy by the entirety cannot be terminated\nwithout the consent of the other party. Tenancy by the entirety does not exist in Arizona\nbecause of our community property laws.\n125\n",

What is right for one could be very wrong for someone else.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nThere are two general classi\ufb01cations of estates: freehold and leasehold. A freehold estate\nis a real property ownership estate of uncertain duration. A leasehold estate is an estate\nthat is less than freehold and lasts a certain duration of time.\nThere are two kinds of frechold estates: fee estates and life estates. A fee simple\nestate gives the owner the greatest interest possible and is of inde\ufb01nite duration. It is\nfully transferable and can be sold, leased, exchanged, or given away. Quali\ufb01ed fees\nare defeasible. There are three types of quali\ufb01ed fees: fee simple determinable, fee sim-\nple on condition subsequent, and fee simple conditional. Fee simple determinable is sub-\nject to a certain restriction, which is included in the deed. Fee simple on condition\nsubsequent places conditions on the grantee. Fee simple conditional has a restriction\non the right of inheritance and is not legal in Arizona\nThere are two kinds of life estates: conventional life estates and legal life estates. Con-\nventional life estates are not inheritable. A conventional life estate is a fee simple estate\ngranted for the life of an individual. The estate is terminated upon the individual's\ndeath. A property owner uses a deed that names the life tenant and speci\ufb01es who will re-\nceive the property at the death of the life tenant. There are three variations of life tenancies,\neach with a difference in the future interest estate in reversion, estate in remainder, and\nestate pur autre vie. A life tenant has al the privileges of ownership for as long as he\nor she lives.\nThere are three legal life estates: dower, curtesy, and homestead. In Arizona, homestead\nis the only legal life estate. Dower and curtesy are not necessary because of Arizona's com-\nmunity property laws. With dower nights, any property bought during marriage belongs to\nthe husband. When any property bought during marriage belongs to the wife, it is known as\ncurtesy rights. Homestead means that a person's primary residence or homestead is exempl\nfrom attachment, execution, and forced sale from creditors. In reality, the equity (not the\nproperty itself) in an owner's primary residence is protected up to S150,000.\nThe homestead exemption law automatically exempts the homestead of any person\n18 years or older who resides in the state and is the head of the household. The law\nChapter 10 \u2022 Freehold Estates and How Property Is Held\nprotects the principal residence. A married couple or a single person may protect only\none homestead. A married couple may claim the homestead, but both spouses must\nclaim the homestead in community or joint property. If a claimant is married, the home-\nstead exemption may protect community or joint property, or it may protect sole and\nseparate property. A homestead may be removed from the property in a number of\nways, including a sale or transfer by deed, moving out of Arizona, or abandonment.\nOne or more persons may hold property. When one person holds property, it is held in\nseveralty. When two or more persons hold property, the tenancy is called concurrent own-\nership. Severalty is taking title as sole owner, either as a natural person or a legal person.\nAll government-owned property, such as streets, buildings, and parks, is owned in sever-\nalty. Concurrent ownership, or co-ownership, is a form of ownership in which two or more\npersons have an undivided interest in the same land. There are \ufb01ve basic forms of concur-\nrent ownership: tenants in common, joint tenancy, community property, community prop-\nerty with rights of survivorship, and tenancy by the entireties. Tenants in common is a\nwidely used form of ownership between multiple parties. In this form of ownership.\neach owner or part owner has an undivided interest and rights of possession of the entire\nparcel. These undivided rights exist even though there may be unequal shares.\nIn joint tenancy, in the case of death, the survivor automatically acquires ownership\nof the property. There are four common-law unities that must be present to create\nJTWRS: possession, interest, title, and time (PITT). The distinguishing characteristic\nof joint tenancy is the right of survivorship, which makes the ownership interest not in-\nheritable. A joint tenant can sell his or her interest or deed it away without the consent of\nthe other owner or owners. This action breaks the tenancy and establishes a new tenancy\ndepending on the number of owners. Joint tenancy can be created again by deeding the\nproperty to a straw person. A straw person is an individual or entity that brie\ufb02y holds\ntitle to the real estate and then transfers the interest at one time to the group of owners\nthat now includes the new owner.\nArizona is one of eight states that have enacted community property laws. In com-\nmunity property, each spouse has ownership of half of the marital property (both real\nand personal), including wages acquired subsequent to marriage. For married couples\nin Arizona, title is automatically taken as community property. Each spouse is free to\nwill his or her half of the community estate. Upon the death of one of the spouses,\none half of the property belongs to the survivor. If there is no will and no children of\nthat marriage, the other half goes to the survivor. If there are heirs and no will, the prop-\nerty will pass by the laws of intestate succession descent.\nCommunity property with rights of survivorship allows a married couple to receive ben-\ne\ufb01ts under the federal tax code for community property while avoiding probate. The four\ncommon-law unities (PITT) required to create a joint tenancy are not required when taking\ntitle as CPWROS. Either spouse may terminate the effect of right of survivorship provision\nby recording an af\ufb01davit. Divorce or annulment terminates the right of survivorship.\nTenancy by the entirety is a type of ownership existing only between husband and wife.\nTenancy by the entirety does not exist in Arizona because of the community property laws.\n127\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\ncommunity property\ncommunity property with rights of\nsurvivorship\nconcurrent ownership or\nco-ownership\nconventional life estate\ncurtesy\ndefeasible\nd o w e r\nestate\n",

A corporation can never\nhold property as a joint tenant because the corporate legal entity generaly has continu-\nous existence and therefore does not die.\nPartnerships\nA partnership includes a group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization\nof two or more people (one or more of whom could be a corporation or other business\nentity) that carries on a business for pro\ufb01t In real estate, a partnership is created by two or\nmore persons or entities joining together to deal in real estate investments for a pro\ufb01t\nA corporation differs from a partnership in that a corporation is a legal entity sep-\narate from its stockholders, whereas a partnership has no legal standing apart from that\nof its partners.\nThere are two types of partnerships: general partnerships and limited partnerships.\nA general partnership involves an association of two or more persons (natural or\nlegal) who share in the management and operation of the business, as well as the pro\ufb01ts\nand losses. Each partner has unlimited liability for all the debts and obligations of the\npartnership. Pro\ufb01ts or losses are assigned to the individual partner according to the\namount of his or her interest in the partnership.\nThe Arizona Uniform Partnership Act allows a partnership to hold title to real prop-\nerty in the name of the partnership.\nLimited partnerships are made up of general partners and limited partners. The\ngeneral partners are responsible not only for the management but also for the entire op-\ncration of the partnership. A general partner has unlimited liability. The limited partners\nhave no voice or responsibility in the management of the partnership. They share in the\npro\ufb01ts and losses, but their risk is generally limited to the amount of their individual in-\nvestment. The Uniform Limited Partnership Act establishes the legality of this type of\nownership and requires a written limited partnership agreement for it.\nCorporations vs. Partnerships-Income Taxes\nThe choice of entity for the ownership of real estate is signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uenced by the\nincome tax consequences of the choice. A summary of the tax differences follows.\nEntity taxation is the basic difference beteen a corporation and a partnership. A\ncorporation is taxed on its income, and the shareholders are taxed when they receive div-\nidends from carings and pro\ufb01ts. An S corporation is an exemption to this rule, which\nwill be discussed later in this session.\nA partnership is required to \ufb01le an information return but is not taxed on its taxable\nincome. The partners report their allocated share of the taxable income on their individ-\nual returns, even if there is no distribution of assets to the partners by the partnership.\nAs a result, in order to avoid double taxation, real estate investments are usually not\nowned by a corporation. An example of the results of double taxation follows:\nTaxable gain on sale of real estate\nCorporation\nPartnership\nCorporate entity taxes at 39%\n$100,000\n$100,000\nAvailable for distribution\nS  3 9 , 0 0 0\nTax on dividend to shareholders at 15% or\n$ 61,000\n$100,000\npartners' share of pro\ufb01ts at 35%\nGain remaining after taxes\n$ 9,150\n$ 51,850\n$ 35,000\n$ 65,000\nChapter 11 \u2022 Entities for Ownership\n1 3 3\nThe increased gain of $13,150 is because the partnership is a conduit for tax pur-\nposes and, therefore, has no taxes at the entity level.\nCorporations vs. Partnerships-Losses\nA partnership's losses are reported by the partners on their individual tax returns,\nwhether or not there is an actual distribution. A corporation, however, can deduct its\nlosses against income only at the entity level. Therefore, the corporate shareholder\nwill not bene\ufb01t from a pass-through o f the losses.\nThe 1986 Tax Reform Act has limited the bene\ufb01t of losses allocated to partners in\nreal estate partnerships. A discussion of federal income taxes, including passive loss lim-\nitations, is included in Chapter 28.\nPotential real estate investors should seek the advice of legal and accounting profes-\nsionals, because the choice of the entity to own real estate can signi\ufb01cantly affect returns\no n the investment.\nLimited Liability Companies\nWith the 1992 passage of the Arizona Limited Liability Company Act (the LLC Act),\nArizona authorized use of the business entity known as a limited liability company.\nThe LLC Act not only bene\ufb01ts small and medium-sized businesses, but also offers\nsome particular bene\ufb01ts to professionals and real estate investors.\nGeneral Characteristics\nA Limited Liability Company (LLC) combines some of the best features of corpora-\ntions, general partnerships, and limited partnerships. LLCs have \"members,\" which are\nsimilar to partners in a partnership and shareholders in a corporation. LLCs offer limited\npersonal liability exposure, full management participation and control rights, and, i f\nproperly structured, direct pass-through income tax advantages,\nA somewhat unexpected bonus added by the Arizona legislature to the LLC Act is\nArticle 11, which extends the bene\ufb01t of the LLC form of doing business to professio-\nnals such as accountants, engineers, appraisers, doctors, lawyers, and brokers. The\nadvantages offered by the LLC Act are substantial and, due to this, LLCs have\nreplaced general and limited partnerships, subchapter S corporations, and some\nother corporations as the preferred business entity for small and medium-sized\nbusinesses.\nOrganization and Management\nThe LLC Act authorizes the organization of LLCs for any lawful purpose, except banking\nor insurance. A limited liability company is formed by \ufb01ling Articles of Organization\nwith the Arizona Corporation Commission, setting forth the following:\n1. The name of the LLC (including the words \"Limited Liability Company\" or\n\"Limited Company\" or the abbreviations \"L.L.C.\" or \"L.C.\")\n2. The address of its registered of\ufb01ce and the name and address of its statutory agent\n3. A statement that there will be two or more members when the LLC is formed\n4. The latest date on which the LLC will dissolve (It is common at the present to\nuse a term of 25 years, which the IRS has accepted as appropriate for tax purposes.)\nS.

Although the legal requirements of an operating agreement\nare deceptively simple, members of an LLC should exercise care to ensure that the oper.\nating agreement clearly sets forth the relationship beteen the members their rights and\nduties) and describes the parameters of the daily business operations of the LLC.\nOpcrating agreements generally specify at a minimum:\n1. The obligations of LLC members to make capital contributions\n2. The rights of members to receive distributions\n3. The rights of members and/or managers to control the LLC business\n4. The members' right to transfer their interests in the LLC\n5. The terms and conditions on which the LLC will dissolve\nUnless the Articles of Organization provide differently, the LLC is managed directly by\nits members, subject to any provision restricting or enlarging the management rights of\none or more members.\nLimited Personal Liability\nProbably the most enticing feature of the limited liability company is the combination of\nallowing business ventures to secure limited personal liability exposure while maintain-\ning full management and control of the LLC business. The LLC Act expressly provides\nthat members, of\ufb01cers, and employees of an LLC are not personally liable to third-party\ncreditors or alleged tort victims solely by virtue of being a member, of\ufb01cer, or employee\nof the LLC.\nWith respect to a Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC), each member is\npersonally liable for malpractice or professional misconduct due to his or her own neg-\nligence or misconduct and for the misconduct of other members or employees under his\nor her direct supervision at the time the alleged misconduct occurred.\nBut professional liability for members of a PLLC will be several only, meaning that\na member is not liable as to his or her personal assets due to negligent acts or profes-\nsional misconduct of other members or employees not under that member's direct\nsupervision.\nIn other words, in order for a professional to be personally liable for malpractice or\nmisconduct, he or she must have been directly involved in the alleged misconduct either\nbecause he or she caused the problem or because he or she was supervising the individ-\nual who did. This narrower standard of personal liability constitutes a signi\ufb01cant depar-\nture and relief from the existing standard of unlimited personal liability for general\npartners of a partnership and for shareholders of a professional corporation.\nFederal Income Tax Advantages\nWhile both an LLC and a corporation generally provide limited liability for their owners,\na properly formed LLC may also receive the favorable income tax treatment of general\nand limited partnerships. If the LLC elects to be treated as a partnership for federal in-\ncome tax purposes, income, loss, and other tax attributes are \"passed through\" to the\nmembers, and the LLC itself is not subject to income taxation. In contrast, a corporation\nis subject to double taxation- not only are shareholders taxed on dividend income they\nreceive from the corporation, but the corporation itself pays a separate tax at the corpo-\nrate level. The election to be treated as a partnership generaly requires the advice from\nlegal and accounting professionals.\nBy de\ufb01nition, al members of an LLC possess limited liability.\nChapter 11 \u2022 Entities for Ownership\nThe LLC Act also offers considerable \ufb02exibility in structuring the management and\ncontinuity of an LLC and the transferability of members' \"interests.\" However, as a re-\nsult of this \ufb02exibility, the tax status of each LLC formed under the LLC Act will be de-\ntermined by how its operating agreement is structured, rather than by the terms of the\nLLC Act. Therefore, the operating agreement must be carefully drafted to insure that\nthe LLC is classi\ufb01ed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nBene\ufb01ts to the Real Estate Industry\nBased on its limited personal liability bene\ufb01ts and partnership tax advantages, the lim-\nited liability company results in signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts to professionals in the real estate in-\ndustry. Through the use of an LLC, real estate investors can now participate fully in the\nmanagement and control of a real estate project, limit the size of the risk, and take ad-\nvantage of the more \ufb02exible tax treatment.\nOTHER CORPORATE ENTITY CHOICES\nOther entity choices for real estate ownership exist; some are variations of the corporate\nform and were established to overcome the problem of double taxation. These entities\nare described below.\nSubchapter S Corporations\nA subchapter S corporation is incorporated pursuant to the laws of the state in exactly\nthe same manner as a C corporation. However, the shareholders elect in accordance with\nsubchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code to make the corporation not subject to in-\ncome taxes imposed by normal corporate rules. As a result, the corporation becomes\na conduit similar to a partnership. The taxable income or losses are allocated to the\nshareholders and reported on their individual returns.\nTo be able to elect under subchapter S, the corporation must\n\u2022 Have 100 or fewer shareholders\n\u2022 Have no corporation shareholders\n\u2022 Have no non-resident alien shareholders\n\u2022 Have only one class of stock\nFor a more comprehensive list of criteria and instructions, see IRS Form 2553-\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2553.pdf\nAlthough a subchapter S corporation is generally taxed like a partnership, there are\ncertain circumstances in which subchapter S corporations and their shareholders may be\nsubject to the same two-tiered tax as regular corporations and their shareholders.\nReal Estate Investment Trusts\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are also known as Massachusetts Trusts or\nCommon Law Trusts.\nCongress passed a law in 1960 exempting certain real estate investment trusts from\npaying corporate tax, as long as they meet certain requirements. A REIT must meet the\nfollowing requirements in order to avoid paying corporate tax:\n1. Seventy-\ufb01ve percent of the assets must be in real estate.\n2. There must be at least 100 owners.\n3. Investors transfer legal title and possession of real estate to the trustee, who\nmanages trust property for their bene\ufb01t.\n4. Investors purchase ownership in the trust, which is transferable.\n135\n",

Income accrues from rent, interest on mortgages, and so on, rather than capital\ngains from sales of real estate.\nAnother advantage of REITs is that an investor with a smal amount of money can invest\nin a trust, which offers a tax advantage, is free from management responsibilities, and\nprovides a diversi\ufb01ed investment. REIT shares often trade on a stock exchange or in\nthe over-the-counter market and, therefore, it is easier to transfer ownership than it is\nto sell an actual parcel of real estate.\nThe choice of a REIT is usually eliminated when smaller real estate investments are\ninvolved, due to the need for 100 owners. The REIT requirement for 100 owners gen-\nerally requires consideration of securities laws (Securities Exchange Commission and\nState Blue Sky). An offering to 100 potential owners could require registration pursuant\nto the Securities Act of 1933. Such a registration is costly and, therefore, eliminates the\npossibility of smaller real estate projects. However, when the requirements can be met, a\nREIT allows \ufb02exibility and many of the corporate and partnership advantages.\nTRUSTS\nA trust is an entity created to own assets, including real and personal property, for the\nbene\ufb01t of a person, persons, or another entity. The trust is created by a trustor, who\ntransfers ownership of the asset or assets to the trust and names a trustee, who manages\nthe property for the bene\ufb01t of one or more bene\ufb01ciaries. The trustee can be an individual\nor a corporation, such as a trust department of a bank or a trust company. The trustor sets\nforth the powers, duties, and responsibilities of the trustee in an instrument, which may\nbe a trust agreement or a will.\nDuring the life of the trust, pro\ufb01ts and sometimes a portion of the principal may be\ndistributed to the bene\ufb01ciaries. After the death of the last trustor, the trustee will distrib-\nute any remaining trust assets to the bene\ufb01ciaries. A trust may take the place of a will\nand avoid probate by providing for the distribution of all remaining assets of the trust\nupon the death of the trustors. Additional advantages of a trust are saving estate taxes\nand providing protection for the bene\ufb01ciaries (usually the spouse and children.\nTypes of Trusts\nThere are many types of trusts, but the three primary types are:\n\u2022 Living trusts\n\u2022 Testamentary trusts\n\u2022 Land trusts\nA living trust, also known as an intervivos trust (Latin for \"within one's life\"), is cre-\nated and takes effect during the trustor's lifetime. A living trust relieves the trustor of the\nresponsibility of handling the estate. The property is transferred to the trustee with\ninstructions to manage the estate and distribute the income from the assets according\nto the trustor's instructions. A living trust generally can be revoked by the trustor at\nany time until the death of the trustor. While a living trust is a generic name for any\ntrust that comes into existence during the lifetime of the person creating the trust, it is\nmost commonly a trust in which the trustors receive bene\ufb01ts from the pro\ufb01ts of the\ntrust during their lifetimes.\nA testamentary trust is similar to a living trust, except that it is set up in a will and\ntakes effect upon the maker's death. The will can name the trustee and bene\ufb01ciaries and pro-\nvides instructions to the trustee for the management and distribution of assets of the trust.\nIn a land trust, real estate is the only asset. The trustor and bene\ufb01ciary are usually\nthe same person. The trustee has ful power to sell, monigage, and manage the property\nChapter 11 \u2022 Entities for Ownership\n1 3 7\naccording to the written provisions of the trust agreement. The bene\ufb01ciary has the rights\nto possession, income, and proceeds of the sale of the property.\nA land trust generally lasts for an extended period, such as 20 years, and can be\nextended. If the bene\ufb01ciary does not extend it, the trustee sells the property and delivers\nthe proceeds to the bene\ufb01ciary. In the past, blind trusts (land trusts in which the own-\nership was not divulged) were very popular in Arizona. Arizona has since passed laws\nmaking blind trusts illegal. The ownership and bene\ufb01ciaries of land trusts must be a mat-\nter of public record.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nIncome taxes and legal liability considerations may make it more desirable to choose\none entity over another as a way to hold title to real estate. The choice of entity is gen-\nerally between a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. A corporation is\nformed by \ufb01ling Articles of Incorporation in the state in which it is to be incorporated. A\ncorporation may own property either in severalty, if the corporation is the sole owner, or\nas tenants in common, if concurrent ownership. A partnership includes a group, pool,\njoint venture, or other unincorporated organization of two or more people (one\nor more of whom could be a corporation or other business entity) that carries on a busi-\nness for pro\ufb01t. There are two types of partnerships: general partnerships and limited\npartnerships.\nA general partnership involves an association of two or more persons (natural or\nlegal) who share in the management and operation of the business, as well as the pro\ufb01ts\nand losses. Limited partnerships are comprised of general partners and limited partners.\nThe general partners are responsible for the management and also the entire operation of\nthe partnership. A general partner has unlimited liability. The limited partners have no\nvoice or responsibility in the management of the partnership. They share in the pro\ufb01ts\nand losses, but their risk is generally limited to the amount of their individual investment.\nEntity taxation is the basic difference between a corporation and a partnership. A\ncorporation is taxed on its income, and the shareholders are taxed when they receive div-\nidends from earings and pro\ufb01ts. A partnership is required to \ufb01le an information retum\nbut is not taxed on its taxable income. The partners report their allocated share of the\ntaxable income and/or losses on their individual retums, whether there is or is not a dis-\ntribution of assets to the partners by the partnership\nA limited liability company combines some of the best features of corporations,\ngeneral partnerships, and limited partnerships. LLCs have \"members,\" which are sim-\nilar to partners in a partnership and shareholders in a corporation. LLCs offer limited\npersonal liability exposure, full management participation and control rights, and, if\nproperly structured, direct pass-through income tax advantages. A limited liability\ncompany is formed by \ufb01ling Articles of Organization with the Arizona Corporation\nCommission. A limited liability company is generally governed by an operating agree-\nment, which is similar to the bylaws and shareholders' agreement of a corporation or the\npartnership agreement of a partnership. The operating agreement sets forth the rights and\nduties of the members and describes the daily business operations of the LLC. The\nArizona Limited Liability Company Act provides that members, of\ufb01cers, and employees\nof an LLC are not personally liable to third-party creditors or alleged tort victims solely\nby virtue of being a member, of\ufb01cer, or employee of the LLC. While both an LLC and a\ncorporation generally provide limited liability for their owners, a properly formed LLC\nmay also receive the favorable income tax treatment of general and limited partnerships.\nIf the LLC elects to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, income,\nloss, and other tax attributes are \"passed through\" to the members, and the LLC itself is\nnot subject to income taxation.\nOther possible entity choices to own real estate include subchapter S corporations\nand real estate investment trusts.

The trustor and bene\ufb01ciary\nare usually the same person. The trustee has full power to sell, mortgage, and manage the\nproperty according to the written provisions of the trust agreement. The bene\ufb01ciary has\nthe rights to possession, income, and proceeds of the sale of the property. A blind trust\nis a land trust in which ownership is not divulged.

All states require that brokers and salespeople be licensed. The agency\nthat i s created between a broker and his or her client is the same as those created\nwith clients and their altomeys, accountants, and architects and should not be looked\nupon lightly.\nTypes of Agents\nA universal agent represents the principal in all matters. He or she can buy or sell real\nand personal property with or without permission. A universal agent must have a written\ndocument stating that he or she is an attorney in fact, thereby giving him or her the\npower of attorney.\n",

    "value": "142\nChapter 12 \u2022 Agency Law and Disclosure\nA general agent represents the principal in a speci\ufb01c range of matters, such as real\nestate. General agencies are created by a power of attomey, but general agents are\nauthorized only to buy or sell in a special category such as real estate. (This is also\nknown as speci\ufb01c power of atorney)\nA special agent is authorized to represent the principal in one speci\ufb01c transaction,\nsuch as in a listing, but is not given the power to bind the principal. The agent is\nemployed to \ufb01nd a ready, willing, and able purchaser but cannot make the decision to\nsell, reject, or accept any offer to purchase.\nCREATION OF AGENCY\nAgency relationships are consensual relationships. One person delegates authority and\nthe agent consents to act. While it is not necessary that agency relationships be created\nin writing, most states, including Arizona, require that listing agreements be in writing.\nThe agency does not have to be a contract with offer, acceptance, and consideration.\nMoney or commission is not necessary in the creation of the agency. In fact, a commis-\nsion or fee may not be paid by the principal or by others, and agency may still exist.\nAlthough a fee is not a necessary part of the agency relationship, if a disagreement\nrelated to the agency develops and a lawsuit is \ufb01led, the courts will look to see if the\ninjured party paid a fee. If so, this could carry considerable weight in a court's verdict.\nThe elements necessary for the creation of agency are de\ufb01ned by law. No matter\nwhat title one puts on his or her actions, if the actions satisfy the elements of the law,\nthen agency exists. The courts judge agency relationship based upon a licensee's actions.\nIf the actions imply agency, even though a written agreement states that agency does not\nexist, it may exist in the opinion of a court. Likewise, the licensee's actions could deny\nthe existence of an agency, even if the parties have signed documents upholding the cre-\nation of an agency.\nIf both of the following occur, an agency relationship is created:\n1. The principal delegates authority to perform acts on his or her behalf.\n2. The agent consents to the authority.\nAgency relationships do not require compensation, a contract, or an agreement in wnt-\ning. The parties to an agency relationship include the following (see Figure 12.1):\n1. Agent-Someone who acts on behalf of another by that person's authority.\n2. Principal-Someone who engages the services of an agent (also called client).\n3. Customer \u2014The third party to whom the seller sells or agrees to sell.\nAgency Relationships\nA number of different agency relationships can be created when dealing with clients. A\nbroker could be in breach of an agency he or she did not know existed without knowl-\nedge of what creates the following types of agencies:\n1. Subagency\n2. Dual agency\nFIGURE 12.1\nReal Estate Agency\nPrincipal\nSeller\nAppoints\nREAL ESTATE AGENCY\nAgent\nReal Estate\nBroker\nTo \ufb01nd\nThird party\nCustomer\nChapter 12 \u2022 Agency Law and Disclosure\n143\n3. Single agency (buyer's or seller's)\n4. Unintended or implied agency\n5. Rati\ufb01ed and estoppel agency\nSubagency\nThe real estate broker is the appointed agent in real estate brokerage transactions, and\nthe licensed salespersons and associate brokers employed by the broker agent are sub-\nagents. A subagent is a person appointed by the broker agent to assist in the perfor-\nmance of the assignment. The subagent owes the broker the same \ufb01duciary duties that\nthe broker owes to the principal. The subagent is also a \ufb01duciary to the broker's\nprincipal.\nDual Agency\nDual agency exists when a broker represents a buyer and a seller at the same time.\nWhether that agency is expressed or implied makes little difference. The broker owes\n\ufb01duciary duties to both parties and must walk a very \ufb01ne line. The creation of dual\nagency is often unintended and implied, and a broker \ufb01nds out after the fact that he\nor she was a dual agent.\nAn in-house sale is a brokerage transaction in which one sales associate obtains the\nlisting and also \ufb01nds the buyer, or a second associate with the same brokerage procures\nthe buyer.\nIn-house sales often result in dual agency. Because all of the listings belong to the\nbroker, any sale by one of his or her salespeople could cause dual agency. In this case,\nthe buyer and seller must sign and give informed consent to the creation of dual agency.\nThey must be aware that they will receive less than client-level services because it is\ndif\ufb01cult, if not impossible, for a broker to carry out his or her \ufb01duciary duties to both\nparties.\nDual agency, whether or not properly disclosed, is illegal in some states. Dual\nagency is legal in Arizona, but both parties must give informed, written consent to\nthe dual agency.\nSingle Agency (Buyer's or Seller's)\nSingle agency is the practice of representing either the buyer or seller, but never both. If\na broker intends to be a single agent, he or she must take special care regarding the sub-\nagents within the of\ufb01ce. If the broker chooses to be a seller's agent, all of the broker's\nsales associates are subagents of the seller, and extra care must be taken to disclose to all\nbuyers that they are not represented by anyone in that transaction.\nIf the broker is a multi-of\ufb01ce brokerage, even more problems could arise due to\nthe number of people who must be supervised. Because agency relationships can be\ncreated by actions, the agency could exist even though a written understanding says\nthat i t does not.\nAn agent may choose to represent buyers only. Some brokers prefer this type o f\nbrokerage because there are fewer problems with listings that do not sell. Represent-\ning buyers only eliminates the cost of advertising listed properties and the cost of\nsigns, but a buyer's agent is under pressure to secure buyers. Unlike a seller's\nagent, a buyer's agent has no ready inventory, so he or she must constantly search\nfor buyers.\nSome buyer's agents use an exclusive retainer agreement, which creates an\nagency relationship with the buyer and is similar to the listing agreement with the seller.\nIn some cases, the buyer pays a retainer fee up front. Then the buyer lists his or her hous-\ning requirements and agrees to pay a brokerage fee to the broker, no matter whom the\nbuyer buys from.\n",

Infonnation regarding available properties can come\nfrom a Multiple Listing Service (MILS) if the broker is a member. The purchase con-\ntract must also disclose the agency relationships that have been established.\nIt is not necessary for a broker to choose between always being a buyer's broker and\nalways being a seller's broker. There may be times when a buyer walks into the broker-\nage and, at that time, the broker may choose to represent that buyer.\nImplied Agency\nUnintended or implied agency exists when the buyer assumes by an agent's actions that\nthe agent is working for the buyer. A broker's desire to make buyers feel comfortable\nand to assist the buyers in their purchase sometimes leads buyers to believe they are\nbeing represented. Simple things done and said to build a rapport can cause this misun-\nderstanding. For example,\n\u2022 \"T'll take care of everything for you.\"\n\u2022 \"Just give them my card and tell them you are working with me.\"\n\u2022 \"I'll set aside the next three days to show you homes, if you agree to work only\nwith me.\"\n\u2022 \"T'll have my mortgage woman call you and set up an interview. She always works\nhard for my people.\"\nBecause an agency is established by one's actions, a broker must take care not to offer\nclient-level services to a customer.\nRati\ufb01ed Agency and Estoppel Agency\nRati\ufb01ed agency is created when a seller or buyer accepts the bene\ufb01ts of an agent's prior\nand unauthorized actions after the fact. When a property is shown without a listing\nagreement, and later the buyer and seller enter into a sales contract, the seller could\nbe bound by the representation (or misrepresentation) of the agent because on the sur-\nface it appears an agency exists. The principal created an agency relationship by accept-\ning the prior unauthorized conduct of the broker.\nEstoppel agency is created when a broker allows a seller or buyer to create the illusion\nthat the broker is his or her agent. For example, a broker may agree to \ufb01nish a transaction\nfor a seller if the seller can no longer handle his or her own sale. As a result, the broker\ncould be responsible for the actions of the seller even before the broker was involved.\nAn information sheet presented to a buyer could explain the merits of the company\nand the services offered both to clients and to customers.\nAgency Disclosure\nThe real estate brokerage and its licensee are required to disclose the type of agency re-\nlationship or representation they wil have with the seller, buyer, or both the seller and\nbuyer.

This aspect of the law of agency is very im-\nportant. The principal entrusts the agent with con\ufb01dential information. In addition,\nthe agent is handling other people's money and property.\nWhether a broker becomes an agent intentionally or unintentionally, he or she will\nbe deemed a \ufb01duciary. Fiduciary duties are the highest range of duties under the law. As\na \ufb01duciary, a real estate broker has agreed, under a listing contract or other employment\nagreement, to these speci\ufb01c duties:\n\u2022 Loyalty\n\u2022 Obedience\n\u2022 Disclosure\n\u2022 Con\ufb01dentiality\n\u2022 Reasonable care and diligence\n\u2022 Accountability\nLoyalty\nLoyalty is the most fundamental duty that an agent owes the principal. Once a broker\nhas taken a listing, all of his or her salespeople become subagents of the seller and have a\nduty to represent the seller's best interests. The agent must present the seller with as\nmuch information about the buyer as possible so that the seller can make an informed\ndecision on any offers presented. The broker must place the seller's interest over his\nor her own and use maximum effort to secure the best possible price and terms for\nthe client. Any broker who does not act accordingly is not acting with the best interest\nof the client and is in breach of his or her \ufb01duciary duties.\nObedience\nAn agent must follow the instructions of the client as long as the instructions are lawful.\nFailure to follow lawful instructions of the client is a violation of the agent's \ufb01duciary\nduties and subjects the agent to liability for any resulting loss. Unlawful seller's instruc-\ntions could include directions to not show the property to a minority or to not disclose a\nmaterial defect in the listed property.\nD i s c l o s u r e\nThe agent has the duty to disclose the following items to the principal:\n1. Relationship of the agent and buyer. The failure to disclose an agent's relationship\nto the buyer (relative, business partner, investor, or close friend) would be a\nviolation of disclosure. If a relationship exists between the buyer and the agent that\nis more personal than the legal relationship between the client and the agent, the\nclient must be made aware of the situation. Disclosure must be made if the agent\nproperty.\nand buyer plan on a business arrangement resulting in the purchase of the client's\n2. Existence of other offers. A listing broker must present all offers to a seller. The\nagent's responsibility to present offers continues until closing because a seller may\ndecide to accept backup offers during escrow.\n3. Potential for a higher price. An agent must disclose the buyer's potential to pay a\nhigher price. An agent must work with a buyer to secure the highest price and best\nChapter 12 \u2022 Agency Law and Disclosure\npossible tens for the seller. The agent must never disclose to a buyer the results\nof any other negotiations indicating that a seller would take a lower price for\n4. Earnest deposit. Clients must fully understand the nature of eamest deposits. Earnest\ndeposits may be in the form of cash, checks, notes, or partial deposit with additional\npayments made at a future date. The agent must inform the client of the form of the\n5. Buyer's \ufb01nancial condition. The seller must have some knowledge of a buyer's ability\nto complete the terms of the contract before he or she accepts an offer to purchase. It\nwould not be in the seller's best interest to take the property off the market or carry\nthe \ufb01nancing himself or herself without suf\ufb01cient knowledge of a buyer's credit-\nworthiness and ability to pay prior to signing a contract.\n6. True property value. An agent should express his or her informed opinion of the\nproperty value. This opinion must be based on fact. False property value could result in\na seller selling for less, or asking too high a price, causing a seller to lose potential\npurchasers. The broker would be liable for establishing a false value on property.\n7. Commission split. An agent must disclose any commission paid by the seller that\nis shared with cooperating brokers. Although the amounts do not need to be spelled\nout, the disclosure that a fee will be shared should be in writing\n147\ncontract prior to a client's signature.\n9. Finder's fees or kickbacks. If an agent will earn extra money by referring clients to\nother industry professionals (such as title companies, inspectors, or those providing\nhome warranties), disclosure must be made.\nCon\ufb01dentiality\nAn agent should regard information learned from the client as con\ufb01dential. An agent\nmust not share any information that could hurt the client's negotiating position. Con\ufb01-\ndentiality does not prevent an agent from disclosing material facts about the property.\nThis con\ufb01dentiality is similar to the privileged information concept of doctor-patient\nand attorney-client relationships.\nReasonable Care and Diligence\nIn offering services to the public as a real estate broker, the broker claims to possess the\nnecessary skill and training to perform the employment requirements. When performing\nduties for the agent's principal, the broker must exercise the reasonable care and\ndiligence the public is entitled to expect. If the principal suffers a \ufb01nancial loss because\nof the agent's negligence or failure to meet the standards of skill and diligence, the agent\nwill be liable for the loss. Also, the principal would not be required to pay compensation\nto the agent as agreed in the listing.\nAccountability\nA broker is responsible for holding any monies received as a result of a purchase agree-\nment. These are trust funds and are held for the bene\ufb01t of the seller. A broker may not\nuse these monies or any interest derived for his or her own or the seller's bene\ufb01t. Like-\nwise, any monies collected as lease payments should be collected and accounted for in\nregular reporting periods. State law prohibits the commingling of trust monies. Commin-\ngling means to mingle or mix, such as depositing client trust funds into the broker's per-\nsonal account.\n",

Rule R4-28-1101 of the Arizona\nCommissioner's Rules stutes\nA bicensee owes a Slaciay dany to his client, and shal protect and promote the interest of\nthe cient.

The obligation to non-clients is to \"deal fairly.\"\nThe concept of \"dealing fairly\" sometimes creates concer for brokers. The courts\nhave interpreted \"deal fairly\" in several cases as honestly and truthfully. A broker and\nhis or her subagents must exercise great care to ensure that all parties to the transaction\nare informed in camest and that their decision to enter into the transaction is based on facts.\nAn agent is liable for misrepresentations to the buyer/customer. An agent may also\nbe responsible for untrue statements made by the seller that the agent then related to the\nbuyer without con\ufb01ning their truth\nThe Arizona courts have consistently held brokers accountable when the broker\nfailed to deal fairly with the buyer, regardless of whom the broker represented.\nMaterial Facts\nThe principal and the principal's agent have a duty to disclose known facts, which are\nnot known to the other parties to the transaction and are not easily observable, that ma-\nlerially affect the value of the property.\nSome examples of material facts that should be disclosed are included here:\n\u2022 Leaky roofs\n\u2022 Termites\n\u2022 Repairs performed by an unlicensed contractor\n\u2022 Prior \ufb01re in the property\n\u2022 Property in or near a Superfund site\n\u2022 Property in the vicinity of a public or military airport\ne agent and the principal have a responsibility to disclose in writing any material defe\nt might affect the consideration paid by the buyer/customer. To be sure that the ag\nand seller are treating al other parties to the transaction fairly, the agent should use due\ndiligence to search for defects in the property. A Buyer's Advisory Checklist, published\na be Arzona Association of REALTORS\u00ae, is a valuable guide that assists buyers\nand their agents in ful\ufb01ling their due diligence responsibilities. The checklist is available\non the Arizona Asociazion of REALTORS& website, htp:/www.aronline.com\nThe proper disclosure by the seller of material facts should be made in writing and in\na timely mannet The writen disclosure is generaly made by completion of the Seler's\nProperty Disclosure Stement (SPDS). The SPS is divided into six general sections.\n1. Ownership and property\n2. Building and safery information\n3 . Umities\n4. Environmental information\nChapter 12 \u2022 Agency Law and Disclosure\n149\n5 . Sewer/water treatment\n6. Other conditions and factors\nSample copies of the Arizona Association of REALTORS\u00ae Seller Advisory and Resi-\ndential SPDS are presented in Figures 12.3 and 12.4 respectively, located at the end of\nt h e chapter.\nA licensee must always be aware of the basis for determining materiality because its\ndetermination is a factual matter ultimately decided by a judge or jury. A fact is consid-\nered material if a reasonable person would attach importance to it when determining his\nor her course of action in the transaction at issue. Those making the determination of\nmateriality could be:\n\u2022 The judge, jury, or hearing of\ufb01cer in a legal dispute\n\u2022 The Arizona Department of Real Estate, or\n\u2022 The consumer, in deciding whether to bring an action\nSeller's Other Disclosure Obligations\nIn addition to disclosing material defects, the seller also has other disclosure obligations,\nwhich include the following:\n1. The duty to disclose the answer to a buyer's inquiry, regardless of whether or not\nthe fact i s material\n2. The duty to disclose any information necessary to prevent a previous statement\nfrom becoming a misrepresentation\n3. The duty to disclose an incorrect assumption that the other party is relying on to\nmake the contract\nDefects Not to Be Disclosed\nSome defects that are generally considered to materially affect the consideration to be\npaid for a property are no longer required to be disclosed by the agent. Under an Arizona\nstatute, disclosure of the following information is not required:\n\u2022 The property is the site of a natural death, suicide, homicide, or any other crime\nclassi\ufb01ed as a felony.\n\u2022 The property is or was owned or occupied by a person exposed to HIV or diagnosed\nas having AIDS or any other disease that is not known to be transmitted through\ncommon occupancy of real estate.\n\u2022 The property is located in the vicinity of a sex offender.\nBecause of this statute, an agent for the seller should not disclose any of the defects\ndescribed in the law even though they might be of concern to a buyer. To disclose\nthese defects would be a breach of the agent's \ufb01duciary duty to treat information with\ncon\ufb01dence. Although the seller and seller's agent are not required to disclose this infor-\nmation, the seller or seller's agent cannot give false information. If, for example, the\nbuyer asks if a murder occurred in the premises and the seller/seller's agent knows\nthat it did, then the seller/seller's agent must either answer the question truthfully\n(that is, yes) or respond by stating that such disclosures are not required by law. The\nseller/seller's agent cannot answer the buyer's question by saying \"no\" or \"I don't\nknow,\" because that answer would be false.\nNaturally, if the seller approves disclosure, the agent can disclose all of these\ndefects, except information about occupancy by a person exposed to HIV or AIDS.\nAn agent is not allowed to disclose any information about occupancy by people exposed\nto HIV or AIDS, even if authorized by the seller.\n",

That theory does not hold true today. More\noften caveat venditor, or \"let the seller beware,\" is appropriate.\nThe buyer has the responsibility of both actual notice and constructive notice. Actual\nnotice means that the buyer should make an actual inspection of the property. Constructive\nnotice means that the buyer should check the public records at the County Recorder's of.\n\ufb01ce for any liens, judgments, lis pendens, mortgages, or attachments on the property.\nAlso, because of the statute eliminating the requirement of the seller or the seller's\nagent to make certain disclosures, the buyer must assume the responsibility to investi-\ngate those areas.\nMisrepresentations and Defects\nAll licensees need to be familiar with the following tenns so that all of their actions re-\nmain within the framework of the law.\nMisrepresentation is a false statement or concealment of a material fact made to\nsomeone entitled to the information, by which that person responds with action and\nthereby suffers damage.\nIn order for a party injured by a misrepresentation to be successful in an action, the\nparty must prove the following:\n1. Reliance. The injured party relied on the false information, and the reliance was\njusti\ufb01ed. Reliance is not justi\ufb01ed if the false information is acquired by the injured\nparty's actions.\n2. Materiality. In order to have grounds for suit, the misrepresentation must be material.\nIf the false statement is trivial in relation to the transaction, the statement is not\nconsidered material.\nNegligent misrepresentation is a statement contrary to fact resulting from failure to ex-\nercise reasonable care in obtaining or communicating infonnation. The licensee could be\nheld liable.\nFraudulent misrepresentation is a deceitful practice or material misstatement\nknown to be false and done with intent to deceive. Remedy through the courts is rescis-\nsion of the contract or actual and punitive damages.\nNegligence occurs when an agent fails to exercise a degree of reasonable caution\nthat would be exercised by a person of ordinary prudence under all existing circumstan-\nces in view of probable danger or injury.\nNegligence per se is conduct that may be declared and treated as negligence with-\nout any proof as to the surrounding circumstances, either because it is in violation of a\nstatute or because it is so opposed to the dictates of common prudence.\nChapter 12 \u2022 Agency Law and Disclosure\nLatent defects are hidden or dormant structural defects. Latent defects known to the\nseller must be disclosed, but the seller does not have liability for unknown latent defects.\nPuf\ufb01ng occurs when an agent makes an exaggerated statement of opinion, without\nintending to deceive, such as, \"This site has the most beautiful view in the valley.\"\nThough it is legal to \"puff,\" it is strongly discouraged as a selling tool.\nCUSTOMER OR CLIENT\nA real estate agent's relationship with a customer differs from his or her relationship\nwith a client. Agents work with customers; they work for clients. It is not always\neasy to decide whether a prospect would be best served as a customer or a client. In\nweighing each situation, here are some points that may help you reach that decision\nwith the prospect.\nCustomer Pro\ufb01le\nA prospective buyer may best be served as a customer when he or she:\n\u2022 Needs exposure to property\n\u2022 Is familiar with real estate practices and procedures\n\u2022 Knows how to \"mentally structure\" an offer\n\u2022 Is capable of negotiating for himself/herself, or\n\u2022 Is capable of analyzing the property and legal forms (or capable of engaging the\nservices of someone who can)\nSome of the services to customers could include the following:\n\u2022 Explaining basic real estate forms\n\u2022 Explaining real estate terms\n\u2022 Providing price ranges of speci\ufb01c areas\n\u2022 Providing information on churches, schools, and so on\n\u2022 Explaining zoning ordinances\n\u2022 Explaining MLS and how it works\n\u2022 Showing properties\n\u2022 Explaining costs involved in a sale\n\u2022 Explaining escrow\n\u2022 Helping to write an offer\n\u2022 Disclosing material facts about property conditions\nClient Pro\ufb01le\nA prospective buyer may best be served as a client when he or she:\n\u2022 Is naive regarding real estate purchases and/or business in general\n\u2022 Has a strong need for help in negotiating\n\u2022 Has limited funds or restricted terms or types of \ufb01nancing\n\u2022 Is a prospect who relies heavily on input from the salesperson (\"What would you\nsuggest I do?\")\n\u2022 Has a con\ufb01dentiality that needs to be kept, or\n\u2022 Is a very cautious, analytical buyer who constantly probes for every detail\n151\n",

All states require that brokers and salespeople be licensed. A uni-\nversal agent represents the principal in all matters. A general agent represents the\nprincipal in a speci\ufb01c range of matters, such as real estate. A special agent is authorized\nto represent the principal in one speci\ufb01c transaction, such as in a listing, but is not given\nthe power to bind the principal.\nAgency relationships are consensual relationships. One person delegates authority\nand the agent consents to act. Agency relationships do not require compensation, a con-\ntract, or an agreement in writing. The elements necessary for the creation of agency are\nde\ufb01ned by law. No matter what title one puts on his or her actions, if the action satis\ufb01es\nthe elements of the law, then agency exists. The parties to an agency relationship are the\nagent, the principal, and the customer\nOther agency relationships include subagency, dual agency, single agency (buyer's or\nseller's), unintended or implied agency, and rati\ufb01ed and estoppel agency. A subagent is a\nperson appointed by the broker agent to assist in the performance of the assignment. The\nsubagent owes the broker the same \ufb01duciary duties that the broker owes to the principal.\nDual agency exists when a broker represents a buyer and a seller at the same time. The\nbroker owes \ufb01duciary duties to both parties and must have written informed consent to rep-\nresent both parties. The creation of dual agency is often unintended and implied. An in-\nhouse sale is a brokerage transaction in which one sales associate obtains the listing and\nalso \ufb01nds the buyer, or a second associate with the same brokerage procures the buyer. Sin-\ngle agency is the practice of representing either the buyer or seller, but never both. Unin-\ntended or implied agency exists when the buyer assumes by an agent's actions that the\nagent is working for the buyer. Rati\ufb01ed and estoppel agency is created when a seller or\nbuyer accepts the bene\ufb01ts of an agent's prior and unauthorized actions \"after the fact.\"\nThe real estate brokerage and its licensee are required to disclose the type of agency rela-\ntionship or representation they will have with the seller, buyer, or both the seller and buyer.\nThe \ufb01duciary relationship is the relationship created between the principal (client)\nand the agent and is one of trust and con\ufb01dence. As a \ufb01duciary, a real estate broker has\nagreed, under a listing contract or other employment agreement, to these speci\ufb01c duties:\nloyalty, obedience, disclosure, con\ufb01dentiality, reasonable care and diligence, and ac-\ncountability. With regard to disclosure, the agent has the duty to disclose the following\nitems to the principal: the relationship of the agent and buyer, the existence of other\n",

An agent must exercise great care to deal fairly with all parties in a trans.\naction. Both the agent and the principal have a responsibility to disclose in writing any\nmaterial defects existing in the property that might affect the consideration paid by the\nbuyer/customer. To ensure that al parties to the transaction are treated fairly and that dis-\nclosure responsibilities are met, the Seller's Advisory Checklist and the Buyer's Advisory\nChecklist are valuable guides to sellers, buyers, and agents. Some defects, however, may\nnot be disclosed. Therefore, agents should thoroughly acquaint themselves with a list of\nitems to be disclosed and those not to be disclosed. Ultimately, because of the statute\neliminating the requirement of the seller or the seller's agent to make certain disclosures,\nthe buyer has the responsibility of both actual notice and constructive notice.\nAl licensees need to be familiar with the following terms so that their actions re-\nmain within the framework of the law in regard to the disclosure of defects: misrepre-\nsentation, negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, negligence and negligence per se,\nlatent defect, and puf\ufb01ng.\nIn determining whether a prospect would best be served as a customer or a client, an\nagent should be knowledgeable of the pro\ufb01les for each.

An employment agreement,\nknown as an exclusive right to locate property, is a contract for personal services be-\ntween a buyer and broker to locate a property. A broker is entitled to compensation for\nservices rendered with this type of contract. Another type of employment agreement is a\nlisting between the seller and broker. This agreement is both a listing contract, listing a\nproperty for sale, and a contract for personal services between the broker and the seller\nto sell the subject property.\nThe statutory requirements for a real estate employment agreement are as follows:\n\u2022 It must be written in clear and unambiguous language.\n\u2022 It must fully set forth al material terms, including the terms of broker compensation.\nChapter 13 \u2022 Listing Agreements\n1 6 5\n\u2022 It must have a de\ufb01nite duration or expiration date, showing dates of inception and\nexpiration.\n\u2022 It must be signed by all parties to the agreement.\n\u2022 A listing agreement cannot be assigned to another licensed brokerage without the\nexpressed writen consent of al parties to the agreement. But, because all listings belong\nto the broker, a broker may assign a listing to another agent within the broker's of\ufb01ce.\n\u2022 A licensee must not acquire or attempt to acquire a listing for property where an\nexclusive listing exists, unless the seller is noti\ufb01ed in writing that he or she may\nbe liable for additional commissions.\nA real estate employment agreement is not required for a licensee to represent a party in\na transaction. However, a written and signed employment agreement is required if a con-\ntroversy arises and the broker wishes to enforce the agreement (that is, to compel pay-\nment of the commission).\nEven though a salesperson may have procured a listing, it does not belong to him or\nher. The broker owns all of the listings. The listings are sometimes called the \"broker's busi-\nness inventory.\" If a salesperson has been responsible for acquiring numerous listings for\nthe brokerage and decides to change brokers, the listings remain with the original broker.\nInformation Required in a Listing\nAlthough certain material facts are required in a listing, standard printed forms for listings\nare not required. However, most Multiple Listing Services (MLSs) have developed forms\nfor use in Arizona. A nonmember of an MLS may develop his or her own format.\nWhe ther the printed forms are used or not, these material facts should be included\ni n all listings:\n\u2022 Price of property\n\u2022 Amount of commission (usually a percentage of sales price)\n\u2022 Date of inception and date of expiration\n\u2022 Names and addresses of broker and seller\n\u2022 Legal description\n\u2022 No-discrimination clause\n\u2022 Financial terms seller is offering\n\u2022 Permission for placing a for-sale sign on the property\n\u2022 90-day clause (or broker protection clause) \u2014This clause provides for the listing\nbroker to be compensated if a buyer was procured during the period of the listing\ncontract and subsequently agreed to purchase the property within the 90-day period.\nThe number of days of broker protection established in the listing is a matter of\nnegotiation between the seller and the broker (that is, it could be 30, 60, 90, 120, 180\ndays, or some other amount of time).\n\u2022 No blanks-If something does not apply, write \"N/A.\"\nThe broker could be held responsible for any error or omissions in the listing. All sub-\nsequent changes to the original listing must be initialed and dated by all parties.\nA commission is not payable until the terms of the employment contract have been\nful\ufb01lled; a ready, willing, and able buyer is found; and a \"meeting of the minds\" occurs\nbetween buyer and seller. There are limitations and exceptions to this statement that are\nfurther explained in the following section and in Chapter 15.\nPreparing a Listing Agreement\nWhen preparing a listing agreement, it is important for the seller to understand the \ufb01ne\nprint. The forms deal with the subject of cooperation with buyers, brokers, and subagency.\nMost sellers do not understand these terms and should be made aware of the provisions of\n",

Open listings\n4. Net listings\nFIGURE 13.1\nTypes of Listings\nTypes Of Listings\nExclusive Right to Sell\nExclusive Agency\nOpen\nNet\nChapter 13 \u2022 Listing Agreements\n167\nExclusive Right to Sell Listing\nThe exclusive right to sell listing is the most widely used type of listing. An exclusive\nright to sell listing is given to only one broker who is employed as an exclusive agent.\nWith this type of listing, only the employed broker is entitled to receive a commission,\nno matter who sells the property. The listing broker then pays the selling broker if there\nis one involved, but if the owner sells the property, the owner must pay a commission to\nthe listing broker, whether or not the broker was the procuring cause. Most listings on an\nMLS are exclusive right to sell listings.\nA copy of the Arizona Association of REALTORS** legal language for an exclu-\nsive right to sell listing is included as Figure 13.2, at the end of this chapter.\nExclusive Agency Listing\nIn an exclusive agency listing, the owner employs one broker as an exclusive agent.\nHowever, the owner, also known as the principal, retains the right to sell the property\nand does not owe a commission to the agency if the owner sells the property. All other\nreal estate agents would deal with the listing agent.\nA copy of the Arizona Association of REALTORS*\" legal language for an exclu-\nsive agency listing is included as Figure 13.3, at the end of this chapter.\nOpen Listing\nOpen listings are generally used with commercial properties rather than residential\nproperties. The owner may employ any number of brokers. The owner retains the\nright to sell without paying a commission and agrees to pay only the \ufb01rst broker who\nprocures a ready, willing, and able buyer who ful\ufb01lls the terms of the listing.\nThis is the least popular type of listing because residential brokers do not want to\nspend the time, effort, and money for advertising if they are not assured of a commis-\nsion. Open listings are not accepted by MLSs, and a broker would not want to place\nsuch a listing on MLS.\nProcuring Cause\nProcuring cause means the direct or proximate cause. For example, in a real estate trans-\naction, the brokerage that located a potential buyer, who then agreed to purchase the listed\nproperty, is considered the procuring cause. Open and agency listings may sometimes cre-\nate problems when a buyer, after being introduced to a property by one broker, enters into\na contract to purchase from another broker or from the seller himself. The introducing bro-\nker could be entitled to a commission if he can prove that the buyer bought the property\nbecause of his efforts, even though a second broker was the one who wrote the contract.\nProcuring cause relates primarily to exclusive agency and open listings.\nNet Listing\nIn a net listing, the owner states a required amount of money to be received by the seller\nand the broker adds a commission. The broker is free to offer the property at anything\nover the net price and the amount of any excess represents the compensation to the bro-\nker. Because this is simply a different way to establish commission, the listing can be an\nopen or exclusive listing. In Arizona, a net listing is legal but its use is discouraged due\nto the potential for fraudulent treatment of the public by the licensee. MLSs will not ac-\ncept net listings.\nExclusive Right to Locate Property\nListings are between the broker and the seller of the real property. Frequently, a buyer of\nreal property asks a broker to locate and negotiate the purchase or lease of property\n",

Reasons for\ntermination include the following:\n\u2022 Sale and the subsequent close of escrow.\n\u2022 Expiration date-The listing has expired.\n\u2022 Broker abandonment or renunciation- A listing can be terminated if the broker has\nbeen asked to perform an illegal or unethical act by the principal or due to lack of\nbroker performance.\n\u2022 Mutual consent \u2014The agent and principal mutually agree to tenninate the listing.\n\u2022 Death or insanity of party-Either the agent or the principal dies or becomes\nincompetent.\n\u2022 Title cannot be transferred-Such as when title is seized in a foreclosure or\ncondemnation action.\n\u2022 Destruction of property-Due to a natural disaster.\n\u2022 Unilateral revocation by the owner for just cause.\n\u2022 Change in the use of property by an outside force-Such as a zoning change.\nThe seller or broker may unilaterally terminate the listing. However, the other party\ncould claim some damages in court. A seller may not unilaterally terminate a listing,\nwithout cause, when the agency is coupled with an interest. An agency coupled with\nan interest is more than a personal service contract. Examples follow:\n\u2022 When a broker pays on the seller's mortgage debt to avoid foreclosure\n\u2022 When a broker pays for \ufb01x-up costs to make the property more marketable\nFIGURE 13.2 Exclusive Right to Sell\nType E R\nEXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO SELL/RENT\n(LISTING CONTRACT LEGAL LANGUAGE)\nS TO THE LEGAL VALIDITY OR ADEQUACY OF AN\nTHIS IS INTENDED TO BE A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT.\nAS IS IN OR TRE RECONSEQUENCES HE OR TACO DESE LEG O\nR TAX ADVICE, CONSULT YOUR ATTORNEY O\nR TAX ADVISOR\n_ to sell, rent, exchange, or\n2\n4\nopion the Premises described in Paragraph Und expiring at 11,59 p.m\nTHE PREMISES.\nStreet Address\nCity/T own\nLegal Description\nper month plus all applicable\nPRICE.

The seller bene\ufb01ts from the ex-\nposure of the listing to all of the MLS members, who number in the thousands; this\nexposure often results in the sale of the listed property in the shortest time with the\nbest possible price.\nVery often, the sale will be made by an agency other than the brokerage that has the\nlisting. The listing broker, however, handles al offers and negotiations. The listing bro-\nker agrees to pay a portion of the commission to the selling broker who procures the\nbuyer. The selling broker is referred to as a cooperating broker and almost always rep-\nresents the buyer.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nThe Arizona Revised Statutes require that real estate employment agreements must be\nwritten in clear and unambiguous language, must fully set forth all material terms,\nmust have a de\ufb01nite duration, and must be signed by all parties to the agreement. An\nemployment agreement cannot be assigned to another licensed brokerage without the\nexpressed written consent of all parties to the agreement. The broker owns all of the\nlistings.\nThe listing agreement is generally a two-part agreement: (1) the legal contract and\n(2) the data-entry sheet for the MLS computer system. The broker is responsible for the\nrepresentation of the client's property and should be certain that a licensee understands\nthe proper way to complete the form. Certain material facts are required in a listing: price\nof property, amount of commission, date of inception and expiration, names and\naddresses of broker and seller, legal description, no-discrimination clause, \ufb01nancial\nterms, permission for placing a for-sale sign on the property, and a 90-day clause. No\nsections of the agreement should be left blank; write \"N/A\" if something does not\napply. The broker could be held responsible for any error or omissions in the listing.\nIf any changes are made on the listing, they must be initialed and dated by all parties.\nA commission is not payable until the terms of the employment contract have been ful-\n\ufb01lled; a ready, willing, and able buyer is found; and a \"meeting of the minds\" occurs\nbetween buyer and seller.\nA listing agreement is prepared in two parts: the legal contract and the data-entry\nsheet for the MLS system. Some of the information required includes a legal description\nof property, assessor number, size and square footage of house, lot size, easements and\ndeed restrictions, taxes, and price. Knowing where, with whom, or how to procure ad-\nditional information is required.\nFour types of listings are used in Arizona: exclusive right to sell listings, exclusive\nagency listings, open listings, and net listings. An exclusive right to sell listing is the\nmost widely used type of listing. It is given to only one broker who is employed as\nan exclusive agent. Only the employed broker is entitled to receive a commission, no\nmatter who sells the property. In an exclusive agency listing, the owner employs one\nbroker as an exclusive agent. However, the owner, also known as the principal, retains\nthe right to sell the property, and does not owe a commission to the agency if the owner\nsells the property. Open listings are used more often with commercial properties. Open\nlistings are the least popular listing because a broker commission is not assured. Procur-\ning cause relates primarily to exclusive agency and open listings. The brokerage that\nlocated a potential buyer, who then agreed to purchase the listed property, is considered\nthe procuring cause. In Arizona, a net listing is legal but its use is discouraged. MLSs\nwill not accept net listings.\nA listing can be terminated through completion of a sale, by agreement between\nagent and principal, by operation of the law, and by impossibility of performance. Rea-\nsons for termination include sale of the property, the expiration of the listing, and mutual\nconsent. A seller may not unilaterally terminate a listing, without cause, when the\nagency is coupled with an interest.\n",

However, abandoned buildings always need to be thoroughly\nevaluated. A sample list of relevant questions to ask when completing a site analysis\nfollows:\n1. Is the subject property an industrial property or is it a property located on land\nzoned for industrial use?\n2. Is the subject property located within close proximity of an industrial area?\n3. Is there any indication that the subject property includes an existing or former\ngas station site, or is the subject property within close proximity of an existing or\nformer gas station site?\n4. Does the subject property include an automotive repair facility or a dry-cleaning\nestablishment where the work is done on the premises?\n5. Is the subject property immediately adjacent to a railroad track or underground pipeline?\n6. Is there any indication that the subject property ever served as a refuse or waste\ndisposal site, or is the subject property within close proximity of a waste disposal\nsite?\n7. Is there any indication that the subject property or surrounding properties could\nhave had in the past (or do have in the present) uses that included the storage or\nusage of hazardous or toxic substances?\n8. Is there any indication that the subject property could contain asbestos material\nthat is friable?\n9.

To your knowledge, is the subject property within close proximity of a state or\nfederal Superfund site?\n11. To your knowledge, is the subject property within close proximity of an oil or\ngas production facility?\nChapter 14 \u2022 Environmental Issues and Arizona Water Law\n183\nENVIRONMENTAL LAW\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of\n1980 (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, was created to provide the authority and a\nsource of funding for cleaning up hazardous materials released into the environment. The\nSuperfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) contains provisions\nde\ufb01ning who is liable to pay for the cleanup of contamination caused by past activities.\nIn some cases, the cost of cleaning up a hazardous waste site can far exceed the value\nof the property, which results in abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial\nfacilities. The expansion or redevelopment of the facilities is complicated by real or per-\nceived environmental contamination; these facilities are referred to as brown\ufb01elds.\nBuyers, sellers, and lenders need to be aware of liability provisions outlined under\nCERCLA/SARA and must take appropriate steps to satisfy the elements of the innocent-\npurchaser defense or, when contamination is found, to obtain data for negotiating the\ncosts associated with cleanup within the terms of the transaction.\nA professional real estate transaction assessment can provide the infor-\nmation needed to satisfy these requirements at a fraction of the cost of the potential\nliability.\nLiability and Innocent-Purchaser Defense\nPotential purchasers need to understand the risk for cleanup liability and to review each\nproperty for the presence of hazardous substances and other possible hazards.\nLiability\nCERCLA de\ufb01nes four categories of persons who are \ufb01nancially responsible for hazard-\nous waste cleanup:\n\u2022 Present owners and operators\n\u2022 Past owners and operators\n\u2022 Transporters of hazardous substances\n\u2022 Generators of hazardous substances\nCurrent property owners and operators who did not cause contamination may still be \ufb01-\nnancially liable for contamination associated with their land. This concept may extend to\n\ufb01nancial institutions that manage properties in trust or that receive properties as a result\nof foreclosure. It applies to property managers, operators, and lessees, as well as owners\na n d lessors.\nStandards of Liability\nFour liability standards apply to federal and state laws:\n1. Strict liability-The laws apply regardless of whether intent to pollute or knowl-\nedge of the situation was present.\n2. Joint and several liability-Each party involved with the property can be made\nresponsible for the total cleanup costs or damages, even when other parties are known\nto have contributed to the problem.\n3. Retroactive liability - A property owner can be responsible for actions occurring\nmany years earlier than the passage of the law, regardless of whether the prior actions\nwere the standard practice of the time or had received approval.\n4. Unending liability-Liability for a problem on a site does not end with the transfer\nof property but extends as long as the problem exists.\n",

However, homeowners can be held liable for cleanup\nwhen their own actions have led to a release of hazardous substances or the propenty\nis used for nonresidential purposes. This policy is designed to reduce concerns about\ncleanup liability for homeowners, as wel as parties involved in real estate transactions,\ns u c h a s lenders.\nInnocent-Purchaser Defense\nSARA amended CERCLA and created an \"innocent purchaser\" defense to owner re-\nsponsibility. To claim innocence, the landowner must demonstrate that at the time of\nproperty acquisition there was \"no reason to know\" that the property was contaminated\nand that \"all good commercial or customary practice\" was undertaken to detect the po-\ntential for property contamination. In most cases, a Phase One Environmental Analysis\nwill serve as an adequate defense. This review should be performed by competent pro-\nfessionals who have expertise in evaluating the presence of hazardous substances and\nother hazards, and who are familiar with the liability implications. It typically involves\nproperty surveys, interviews with owners and local govemment, and reviews of histor-\nical records to determine the potential for contamination on the property. Some states\nhave similar or expanded provisions.\nBrown\ufb01elds Cleanup and Redevelopment\nSince its inception in 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Brown\ufb01elds\nProgram has grown into a proven, results-oriented program that has changed the way\ncontaminated property is perceived, addressed, and managed. The program is designed\nto empower states, communities, and other economic development interests to work to-\ngether in a timely manner to prevent, assess, safely clean up, and sustainably reuse\nbrown\ufb01elds. As previously described, a brown\ufb01eld is a property, the expansion, rede-\nvelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence\nof a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. It is estimated that there are more\nthan 450,000 brown\ufb01elds in the United States. Cleaning up and reinvesting in these\nproperties increases local tax bases, facilitates job growth, utilizes existing infrastructure,\ntakes development pressures off of undeveloped open land, and both improves and pro-\ntects the environment.\nWhen compared with other real estate development projects, several challenges\nmake brown\ufb01eld cleanup and redevelopment unique. These challenges include:\n\u2022 Environmental liability concems\n\u2022 Financial barriers\n\u2022 Cleanup considerations\n\u2022 Reuse planning\nIn spite of these challenges, signi\ufb01cant opportunities exist for successful brown\ufb01eld\nredevelopment. A redevelopment idea that works to bring new life to an area,\nenhanced by public support for the project, can create the momentum necessary to\novercome the challenges associated with brown\ufb01eld transactions (http://www.epa.-\ngov/brown\ufb01elds).\nOther Federal and State Legislation\nOther federal and state environmental laws also place a signi\ufb01cant liability burden on\nproperty that is found to have hazardous substances.\nChapter 14 \u2022 Environmental Issues and Arizona Water Law\nThese laws and regulations focus on releases of hazardous substances to the envi-\nronment or people's exposure to these substances. Releases are de\ufb01ned broadly and in-\nclude unintentional as well as intentional acts, and small, chronic releases as well as\nsudden, major releases.\nCommon law is also a source of potential liability for problems found on property\nthat has been transferred. Common-law provisions focus on the concepts of nuisance,\nnegligence, nondisclosure, and misrepresentation.\n185\nFederal Laws\nIn addition to CERCLA/SARA, some other federal laws that can affect property are\nlisted below:\n\u2022 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) including the Hazardous and\nSolid Waste Amendments of 1984-Subtitle C of the act provides for management\nof the generation, transport, and disposal of hazardous wastes. The 1984 amend-\nments concern the regulation of underground storage tanks to stop the tanks\nfrom leaking, contaminating the soil, or polluting the groundwater. Currently,\nall underground storage tanks must be equipped with an EPA leak-detector\nsystem.\n\u2022 Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act)-This act covers a wide\nrange of issues related to water pollution control, including e\ufb02uent limits, a\npriority pollutant list, drinking water standards, and the National Pollutant\nDischarge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting process. One section of the act\nregulates the discharge of dredged or \ufb01ll material into navigable waters of the\nUnited States. The Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA, organizations that are\nresponsible for administering the act, also consider wetlands protected waters. The\nEPA has de\ufb01ned wetlands as \"those areas that are inundated or saturated by\nsurface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration suf\ufb01cient to support, and\nthat under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically\nadapted for life in saturated soil conditions.\" The de\ufb01nition, as interpreted, can\napply to the \ufb01lling or altering of Arizona's dry, desert washes or doing site work\non lowland vegetated areas and altering arti\ufb01cial lakes and streams.\n\u2022 Clean Air Act-This act addresses a wide range of issues related to air pollution\ncontrol, including pollutant emissions limitations, air quality criteria and control\ntechniques, and more. The Prevention of Signi\ufb01cant Deterioration (PSD) program\nrequires an assessment of air pollution impacts on soil and vegetation. Under National\nEmissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), buildings contain-\ning asbestos cannot be renovated or demolished unless the asbestos-containing\nmaterial is removed.\n\u2022 Safe Drinking Water Act-This act provides for regulation of public drinking\nwater systems, establishment of national drinking water regulations, and control\nof underground injection of waste materials.\n\u2022 Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA)-TSCA provides for the regulation of the\ndevelopment, testing, manufacture, transportation, and use of toxic chemical sub-\nstances and mixtures.\n\u2022 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) \u2014FIFRA provides for\nregulation of the use and disposal of pesticides\n\u2022 Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) \u2014AHERA provides for the\ninspection of schools for asbestos-containing materials and their removal, i f\nfound\n",

The fol-\nlowing is the principal act in Arizona:\n\u2022 Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund (WQARF) -WQARF is known as the\nArizona \"mini-Superfund.\" This act is part of the Arizona Environmental Quality\nAct of 1986. Liability is similar to CERCLA-strict, joint, and several, and includes\nretroactive liability for past releases. However, the owner or lessee of property is\nnot liable under the WARF legislation if underground contamination seeps under\nhis or her property from an adjacent property, as long as he or she had no part in\ncausing the contamination.\nHAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES\nHazardous substances that pollute the air, soil, and water all affect the market value of a\nreal estate site. The known presence of any hazardous substance on a real estate site\nmust be disclosed to a potential buyer. Licensees should be familiar with the following\nhazardous substances.\nAsbestos\nAsbestos is a mineral \ufb01ber found in rocks. There are several kinds of asbestos \ufb01bers that\nare \ufb01re resistant and extremely durable. These qualities made asbestos very useful in\nconstruction and industry. Asbestos was commonly used until 1980. Since then, the\nuse of asbestos has declined signi\ufb01cantly.\nDangers of Asbestos\nThe inhalation of asbestos \ufb01bers can cause vanious types of cancer, including asbestosis,\na serious degenerative lung disease. The breathing of asbestos \ufb01bers, which most often\nescape into the air when surfaces coated with friable asbestos begin to deteriorate, causes\nthe danger posed by asbestos. Asbestos is called friable if it crumbles easily when sub-\njected to pressure.\nAlthough the dangers associated with the use of asbestos were known for quite\nsome time, asbestos's superior \ufb01re resistance and insulating abilities dictated its use\nfor a long time. Between 1900 and 1980, approximately 30 million tons of asbestos\nwere used in the United States, mostly to cover hot water pipes, ducts, and boilers,\nand in vinyl \ufb02oor tiles, siding, and roo\ufb01ng shingles. Up until the late 1970s, asbestos\nwas used extensively as a spray-on insulation material for buildings. By some estimates,\n95 percent of houses that are more than 50 years old and heated with steam or hot water\ncontain asbestos in some form.\nThree Types of Asbestos\nThree common types of materials can contain friable asbestos, which may signal the\nneed for further investigation.\n\u2022 The \ufb01rst type is either a \ufb02uffy, sprayed-on material used for \ufb01reproo\ufb01ng ceilings\nor walls (it often looks like cotton candy) or a sprayed or troweled-on material\nresembling a granular, cement-like plaster, usualy used for \ufb01reproo\ufb01ng and sound-\nproo\ufb01ng on walls and ceilings.\n\u2022 The second type consists of nonfriable asbestos wallboard that presents little\nthreat, unless it is broken and has sprayed or troweled-on friable insulation material\nb e h i n d it.\nChapter 14 \u2022 Environmental Issues and Arizona Water Law\n\u2022 The third type of material is asbestos-based pipe or boiler insulation, and it may\nappear as felt-like, cement-like, or resemble a \ufb01brous wrapping paper.\nDue to federal legislation that required asbestos inspections to occur in every school\nin the nation, most local county health of\ufb01cials are knowledgeable regarding asbestos\nidenti\ufb01cation. Furthermore, every EPA regional of\ufb01ce has a Regional Asbestos Coordi-\nnator, who can provide names of local laboratories and contractors to assist in testing for\nand removing asbestos.\nAgent's Responsibility\nPotentially signi\ufb01cant health threats can be posed by the presence of friable asbestos in\nbuildings and homes. A real estate licensee does not normally possess the knowledge\nneeded to determine the presence of asbestos and whether it represents a health hazard.\nUnder Regulation R-4-28-1101 of the Arizona Administrative Code, if licensees have\nreason to suspect that asbestos may be present, they should exercise due diligence to in-\nsure that the material is not disturbed (scraped, sanded, drilled through, and so on), dis-\nclose their suspicion to all parties to the transaction, and recommend in writing that an\ninspection be made.\nRadon\nRadon is a radioactive gas produced when certain natural radioactive minerals break\ndown or decay. These natural minerals are always present in the environment in slight\namounts and are found in increased quantities in particular geologic deposits. Radon gas\nfurther decays into smaller particles, which can attach to soil or dust particles in the air.\nAs these particles are inhaled, the smaller particles can be deposited on the lining of the\nlungs and emit radioactive particles. This radioactive decay damages lung tissues and\nmay cause cancer.\nRadon gas can enter a structure by way of slab cracks and leaks and through porous\nbuilding materials. The highest radon readings are usually found in the lowest levels of a\nstructure and decrease signi\ufb01cantly on the \ufb01rst and second \ufb02oors.\nIndoor radon concentrations depend on many factors: the concentration of radon in\nthe underlying soil, the ease with which the radon can move through the soil, and several\naspects of the house construction. Testing for the maximum radon reading is done in the\nlowest level of the building. Various sampling techniques are available through special-\nized contractors.\nA real estate licensee does not possess the technical expertise necessary to predict\nwhich homes will have elevated radon levels. Local, state, and federal environmental\nand health of\ufb01cials, as well as private environmental consultants, can often provide\nsuch information.\nLead-Based Paint\nThe federal govemment has considerably strengthened its regulation of lead products.\nRecognizing that lead can be extremely toxic, impair physical and mental develop-\nment of young children, and can lead to increases in high blood pressure in adults,\nthe EPA, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Consumer Product\nSafety Commission have moved to restrict people's exposure to lead.\nLead Poisoning\nThe presence of old lead-based paint in houses represents the most signi\ufb01cant concem\nfor lead poisoning, particularly for young children. The principal means of exposure is\nthrough ingestion of peeled and \ufb02aking pieces of paint, which is a signi\ufb01cant problem in\n187\n",

At times, even\nperfectly intact lead-based paint can be the source of lead poisoning. For example, if a\nstainvay banister is painted with intact (non\ufb02aking) lead-based paint, and a young child\nbegins to chew the wood on the banister, the child wil ingest lead.\nIt is estimated that a total of 30 to 40 million older homes around the country con-\ntain lead-based paint. Many cities have passed ordinances requiring a seller's certi\ufb01ca-\ntion that no hazards exist or the actual removal of all lead-based paint from any\nresidence or building before the sale of the building. Testing for the presence of lead-\nbased paint can be done in two ways-through laboratory analysis of paint chips or\nby portable x-ray \ufb02uorescence analyzers.\nSellers and lessors of most residential properties built before 1978 are required to\ndisclose the presence of known lead-based paint hazards. Figure 14.l is a sample copy\nof the Arizona Association of REALTORS\u00ae Lead-Based Paint Disclosure Form.\nUrea-Formaldehyde Foam Insulation\nUrea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) is a thermal insulation material that is\npumped into the spaces between the walls of a building, where it hardens to form a\nsolid layer of insulation. Its shaving cream-like quality enables UFFI to \ufb01ll hard-to-\nreach places. UFFI has been installed in an estimated half million homes in the United\nStates.\nControversial Ban\nIn 1982, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned the future sale and\ninstallation of UFFL, having determined that it presented a health hazard due to the form-\naldehyde gas released from the UFFI product in building interiors. The health problems\nrange from sinus imtations to cancer. The CPSC was not able to identify a level of form-\naldehyde exposure at which the general population could be assured of no adverse\neffects.\nThe CPSC ban was subsequently challenged through litigation, with the court \ufb01nd-\ning that the CPSC did not have suf\ufb01cient evidence to issue a ban. The court, however,\nspeci\ufb01cally declined to hold that UFFI was a harmless substance. The CPSC ban on\nUFFI's installation was lifted, although public opinion resulting from this controversy\ndramatically reduced UFFI's popularity as insulation.\nAlthough a real estate licensee does not possess the technical expertise needed to de-\ntermine the presence of UFFI and its health risks, local, state, or federal environmental\nand health of\ufb01cials can often provide information. Additionally, expensive options do\nexist for those clients who believe further action is warranted. These options include test-\ning indoor air for the presence of formaldehyde and actual removal of UFFI from walls.\nUnderground Storage Tanks\nUnderground storage tank (UST) registration is required for all tanks containing regu-\nlated substances (all petroleum products) that are not already listed as hazardous\n\"wastes.\" Look for existing records or registrations with the state UST section. Some\nguidelines follow:\n\u2022 Any tank having held a regulated substance needs a site assessment and proper\nclosure. Any materials held in the tank also need to be properly disposed.\n\u2022 Any tanks brought into current use or already being used will be regulated. This\ninvolves the owner's certi\ufb01cation of one million dollars in \ufb01nancial responsibility\nand/or insurance coverage. Owners and operators have to keep responsible records.\nAl tanks must have leak-protection systems of varying degrees of protection and\nrecords must be kept of the operation of that system.\nFIGURE 14.1 AAR Lead-Based Paint Disclosure Form\nDISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ON LEAD-BASED PAINT\nAND LEAD-BASED PAINT HAZARDS (RENTALS)\nProperty Address:\nLead Warning Statement: Housing buit before 1978 may contain lead-based paint.

The folowing recommended steps are provided to help\nREALTORS\u00ae meet the law's obligations in a typical residential rental transaction.\n1. When entering into an agreement to manago a property, the property manager/isting agent (hereinafter property man.\nager) should determine il the property is target housing * (generaly, built before January 1,1978). This can generally\nbe accomplished by asking the landlord/owner (The owner\"). Il the owner doesn't know, the property manager should\nconsult property records.\nThe property manager should also determine if the property falls within an exemption from the lead-based paint dis-\nclosure requirements. For example, it a certi\ufb01ed inspector has determined that the property is free from lead-based\npaint and lead-based paint hazards, or if the lease is for less than 100 days with no opportunity for renewal or exten-\nsion, the disclosure requirements wil not apply. Even it an exemption applies, the property manager should have the\nowner complete and sign the disclosure form, acknowledging in writing the claimed basis for the exemption. If an\nexemption applies, the disclosure form need not be given to potential tenants.\n2. The lead-based paint disclosure requirements became effective for all \"target housing\" on December 6, 1996. Al tar-\nget housing will require the following steps.\n3. Il the property is target housing, the property manager must advise the owner of certain obligations, namely the fol-\nlowing: 1) disclose to the tenant known lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards; 2) provide the tenant any exist-\ning records, test results, reports, or other known lead-based paint information related to the presence of lead-based\npaint or lead-based paint hezards in the property, if any, 3) provide the tenant with the pamphlet Protect Your Family\nFrom Lead in Your Home (EPA approved lead-based paint hazard information pamphlet); and 4) include disclosure and\nacknowledgment language as part of the rental contract or addenda. (NOTE: The law does not require that all inter-\nested tenants must be informed, only the actual tenant).\n4 . The property manager should have the owner complete, initial and sign the disclosure form. The property manager\nshould obtain from the landlord any records, test results, reports, or other lead-based paint information related to the\npresence of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in order to be ready to provide copies to a tenant making an\noffer to rent the property. The property manager should then initial and sign the form.\nThe property manager should disclose to potential leasing agents that the listed property is target housing, probab\nrough the MLS or other offerings to REALTORS\nThe leasing agent (the agent working with the tenant who expects to be paid by the property manager or the owner -\nwhether it be tenant's agent, subagent, \"Tacilitator,\" or whatever) also has an obligation to ensure the owner's compli-\nance. Il the disclosure form has not been provided by the property manager, the leasing agent should provide the dis-\nclosure form to the property manager for the owner to complete and sign, or directly to the owner if no property man-\n7. When the tenant is ready to make an ofter on target housing, the leasing agent should provide the tenant with a copy\nof the disclosure form signed by the owner and the property manager, together with related test results and records, it\nany, and a copy of Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home. Ideally, these documents wil be obtained by the leas-\ning agent from the property manager before the o\ufb02er is signed by the tenant, but the signed disclosure form with attach-\nments must be provided to the tenant before the offer to rent is accepted by the owner.\n8. The disclosure form must be initialed and signed by the tenant and the leasing agent, which should be done after the\nowner and the property manager have initialed and signed the form. (By initialing section F of the AAR Disclosure of\nInformation on Lead-Based Paint and Lead-Based Paint Hazards (Rentals) form, signing the Certi\ufb01cation, and com-\ntions under the law.)\nplying with the other terms of this AAR form, both the property manager and leasing agent wil have met their obliga-\nM \n4 4 3   \u0e41 \u0e01 \u0e27   ( r e   m e\n\u2022ARIZONA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS FORM LEPOIRENTAL) CANT\nChapter 14 \u2022 Environmental Issues and Arizona Water Law\n191\nMold\nMold has been around forever, and it is a rare home that does not have some mold.\nHowever, a certain kind of black mold (stachybotrys) has been identi\ufb01ed as a major con-\ntributor to illness. However, not all black mold is toxic, and the presence of stachybotrys\ncan be determined only by a laboratory test. Mold growth can also affect the structural\nintegrity of a building because the surface on which the mold is living serves as its food\nsource. Mold growth requires water and is found underneath materials where water has\ndamaged surfaces or behind walls. By the time mold becomes visible, it has often caused\nmajor damage in the wall interior.\nMolds can be found in all areas of the nation and they thrive in Arizona in spite of\nits dry climate. Mold can grow anywhere there is water, including water from leaking\npipes, leaking roofs, or humidity.\nIn recent years there have been numerous awards and settlements related to mold\nlawsuit claims. Insurance companies have paid millions of dollars to resolve the legal\nclaims. As a result, homebuyers can have dif\ufb01culty purchasing insurance coverage for\na house that has a record of water damage.\nElectromagnetic Fields\nThe movement of electrical current creates an electromagnetic \ufb01eld (EMF). This\nincludes the use of small appliances such as televisions, computers, or even hair dryers.\nHowever, high-voltage power lines, ordinary distribution lines, and transformers have\nbeen suspected of causing cancer and other illnesses. On the other hand, there is\nsome evidence that electromagnetic \ufb01elds, sometimes referred to as EMFs, do not\ncause any health hazards. A homebuyer might consider an EMF in the vicinity of a\nhouse to be a material defect. Therefore, until there is more evidence regarding the po-\ntential health risks of a nearby power line, a licensee must ensure disclosure about a\nnearby EMF to a potential buyer.\nClandestine Drug Laboratories\nClandestine drug laboratories, often referred to as meth labs, utilize chemicals and\nequipment in the manufacture of illegal substances, such as methamphetamine, ecstasy,\nor LSD. Meth labs can cause substantial damage to an owner's real property and they are\nvery hazardous and potentially explosive environments. A clandestine drug laboratory\nbecomes an emergency immediately upon discovery. Strong odors and suspicious be-\nhavior are often indicators of a laboratory operation.\nAt the time of a clandestine drug laboratory discovery or arrest of a laboratory op-\nerator, the owner of the real property is noti\ufb01ed of the lab removal. Arizona Revised\nStatutes require the owner of the real property to remediate the residually contaminated\nportion of the real property within 12 months after the date of notice of removal. The\nremediation must be completed by a registered drug laboratory remediation \ufb01rm.\nUntil the remediation is complete, the following notice requirements apply:\n1. Within 5 days after a buyer signs a contract to purchase the real property, the owner\nshall notify the buyer in writing that methamphetamine, ecstasy, or LSD was\nmanufactured on the real property or that an arrest was made pursuant to that alleged\nactivity. The buyer shall acknowledge receipt of the notice. A buyer can cancel\nthe real estate purchase contract within 5 days after receiving the notice. If the owner\ndoes not comply with the notice requirement, the buyer may cancel the purchase\ncontract.\n2. The landlord shall notify a prospective tenant for a dwelling unit that a clandestine lab\nwas on the real property or that an arrest was made. The tenant shall acknowledge\nreceipt of the notice before taking possession of the dwelling unit or before signing a\n",

Within those two classi\ufb01cations are several different legal categories\nof water in Arizona, each governed by a different body of law. Some of these categories\nare described in the following section.\nColorado River Water\nColorado River water is a category of suface water that is governed by federal law and\nadministered by the Department of Interior through the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bu-\nreau of Reclamation estimates the annual watershed, and allocations are based on per-\ncentages de\ufb01ned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nCalifornia and Nevada have attempted in the past to increase their allocations at\nArizona's expense. It seems untikely that the courts would look on any challenge favor-\nably, but the consensus opinion is that Nevada will probably attempt to raise the reallo-\ncation issue again. The major reason why such an attempt on their part might succeed is\nthat Arizona has never used its entire allocation. This is because Arizona has not had an\ninfrastructure or reserve system suf\ufb01cient in capacity. The completion of the Central\nArizona Project and the new Waddel Dam expanding Lake Pleasant's reserve capacity\nhas substantially helped Arizona in its ability to take, store, and deliver waters that it has\nhistorically lost\nColorado River Water Allocated to Central Arizona Project\nCertain amounts of Colorado River surface water are annually allocated to the Central\nArizona Project (CAP). CAP is the federal Bureau of Reclamation project to build the\nGrand Canal that delivers water from the Colorado River to central Arizona. This water\nis extracted al Alamo Dam and pumped into the Grand Canal. Once the water passes\nthrough the gate, it ceases to be under Colorado River legal control and falls under\nthe Reclamation Refom Act.\nThe Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD) was created to inter-\nface between the federal goverument and end users. It is CAWCD that contracts with\nCAP and in turn re-contracts with users.\nSurface Water\nThe intenor surface watersheds of Arizona, meaning non- Colorado River surface water,\nare governed by the prior appropriation doctrine. This means that the oldest historic\nusers have pnor right to later claimants. The majority of claims were originally judged\nin 1908 in favor of the Salt River Project, one of the \ufb01rst major water reclamation proj-\nects in the United States that provides water resources to the Phoenix metropolitan area.\nIn 1974, the Salt River Valey Water Users' Association \ufb01led a petition with the\nState Land Department for adjudication of its water rights under the existing state stat-\nutes. In 1979, those statutes were repealed and replaced by new statutes. As a result of\nthe new statutes, the petition was transferred to Maricopa County Superior Court, where\nit was consolidated with other similar actions from other counties. The litigation\nChapter 14 \u2022 Environmental Issues and Arizona Water Law\neventually involved over 27,000 parties and over 77,000 individual claims. This litiga-\ntion seeks to de\ufb01ne (or rede\ufb01ne) and allocate water rights in Arizona. Because of the far-\nreaching effects of this litigation and the number of litigants involved, the Supreme\nCourt of Arizona established special rules for the handling of this litigation. This case\nhas now been pending for more than 20 years and may very likely take another 5 or\n10 years to resolve.\nWhen rescarching groundwater and surface water rights, real estate agents/brokers\nmust remember this: Determining whether a speci\ufb01c parcel of land has an adequate\nwater supply, both now and in the future, may be a much more complex question\nthan previously thought. In areas where water rights are in question and certainly for\nproperties where water rights are dependent upon private wells and/or private water\ncompanies, further investigation into the status of the property's water rights may be\nnecessary\nCourts are currently clarifying the de\ufb01nitions of surface water and groundwater. As\nthings stand now, surface water is water that sits or \ufb02ows above the earth and includes\nunderground water that is the result of the surface water by virtue of percolation. To be\nde\ufb01ned as groundwater, the supply must be nonderivative from an identi\ufb01able surface\nsource. In some cases, it may be possible to sever and transfer surface rights within a\ngiven watershed.\nGroundwater-Active Management Areas\nGroundwater is actually controlled by two separate bodies of law determined by the lo-\ncation of the property from where the water will be withdrawn. Arizona is divided into\nactive management areas (AMAs) and open areas. The \ufb01ve AMAs are Prescott,\nPhoenix, Pinal County, Santa Cruz County, and Tucson.\nInside the \ufb01ve AMAs, water can be withdrawn from the ground only in the follow-\ning situations: (I) for the expansion of municipal provider service areas, (2) by special\npermits, or (3) by virtue of grandfathered rights.\nWithin the boundaries of their existing service areas, cities, towns, and private water\ncompanies may drill new wells to assist expansion. The special permits would generally\nnot apply to a real estate development. Special permits were principally designed for cer-\ntain unique situations that rarely exist. Two instances where special permits might be\nissued are:\n1. Exempt domestic wells, which may pump 35 gallons per minute\n2. General industrial use permits, which were designed to pave the way for job growth\nand attract industry\nGrandfathered rights were written into the 1980 Groundwater Management Act to pro-\ntect the rights of historic users while prohibiting new uses. There are three types under\n1. Irrigation grandfathered rights apply to farming for cash crops. These rights run\nwith the land forever and are automatically conveyed when the land is conveyed.\nThey are inseparable from title to the land. Every farmer who properly applied for the\nrights has a \ufb01xed number of irrigation acres and amount of water per acre. A\nsystem called the \ufb02exible account allows farmers to accrue credits in order to use\nmore water in some years and less in others.\n2. Type 1 nonirrigation grandfathered rights occur when a farm is converted to a\nnonfarming use. These rights may be used for any commercial purpose, except\nfarming. These rights are not transferable. It is important to note two things here:\n\u2022 The choice to convert the use is irrevocable.\n\u2022 The amount of allocation is diminished by half normally, but may never exceed\n3 acre-feet per acre per year.\n193\n",

Examples include mines, dairy fans, and some\nbuildings that had wells to run water through their cooling systems. These rights\nare unique in that they may be transferred to any site within the AMA in which\nthey arose. This would give a person acquiring such a right the ability to drill a\nwel for a commercial purpose when he or she otherwise might not be able to.\nThis transferability gives Type 2 rights a market value. Type 2 rights are consi-\ndered personal property.\nGroundwater-Outside Active Management Areas\nGroundwater that is outside active management areas may be withdrawn for necessary\npurposes, though permits to drill must be obtained from the Department of Water\nResources. Certain areas identi\ufb01ed as Imgation Nonexpansion Areas (INAs) are areas\nwhere expansion of farming is not allowed, but other uses may be allowed.\nOther Water De\ufb01nitions\nAn acre-foot is a volume of water equal to an area of 1 acre with a depth of 1 foot\n(43,560 cubic feet) and equal to 325,850 gallons.\nPotable water is water that can be safely and agreeably used to drink.\nA water table is the natural level at which water will be located, be it above or\nbelow the surface of the ground.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nAlmost any type of property could be contaminated by an environmental hazard and\nshould undergo a preliminary site analysis. A site analysis includes an examination of\nthe site and surrounding properties for indications of solid waste disposal, soil contam-\nination, air pollution, and water pollution. In general, looking at on-site and surrounding\nproperties is more important than looking inside buildings.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of\n1980 (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, was created to provide the authority and a\nsource of funding for cleaning up hazardous materials released into the environment.\nThe Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) contains provisions\nde\ufb01ning who is liable to pay for the cleanup of contamination caused by past activities. In\nsome cases, the cost of property cleanup is greater than the value of the property; such\nproperties are caled brown\ufb01elds. Buyers, sellers, and lenders need to be aware of liability\nprovisions outlined under CERCLA/SARA and must take appropriate steps to satisfy the\nelements of the innocent-purchaser defense or, when contamination is found, to obtain data\nfor negotiating the costs associated with cleanup within the terms of the transaction.\nCERCLA de\ufb01nes four categories of persons who are \ufb01nancially responsible for haz-\nardous waste cleanup: present owners and operators, past owners and operators, trans-\nporters of hazardous substances, and generators of hazardous substances. In addition,\nthe four liability standards applicable to federal and state laws are strict liability, joint\nand several liability, retroactive liability, and unending liability. Residential homeowners\nare not liable for cleanup at state and federal Superfund sites, unless their actions have led\n10 a release of hazardous substances or the property is used for nonresidential purposes.\nSARA amended CERCLA and created an innocent-purchaser defense to owner respon-\nsibility. In most cases a Phase One Environmental Analysis, performed by a hazardous\nwaste professional, will serve as an adequate innocent-purchaser defense.\nOther federal laws include, but are not limited to, the Federal Water Pollution Con-\ntrol Act (Clean Water Act), the Clean Air Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\nChapter 14 \u2022 Environmental Issues and Arizona Water Law\nA principal act in Arizona is the Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund (WQARF),\nknown as the Arizona \"mini-Superfund.\" Liability is similar to CERCLA.\nHazardous substances can pollute the air, soil, and water thereby affecting the mar-\nket value of a real estate site. The known presence of the following seven hazardous sub-\nstances on a real estate site must be disclosed to a potential buyer: asbestos, radon, lead,\nurea-formaldehyde foam insulation, underground storage tanks containing regulated\nsubstances, mold, and electromagnetic \ufb01elds.\nThe two major categories of water are surface water and groundwater. Within those\ntwo calegories are several different legal categories of water in Arizona. Colorado River\nsurface water is governed by federal law and administered by the Department of Interior\nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bureau of Reclamation estimates the annual\nwatershed, and allocations are based on percentages de\ufb01ned by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt. Certain amounts of Colorado River surface water are annually allocated to the\nCentral Arizona Project (CAP). The CAP is the federal Bureau of Reclamation project\nto build the Grand Canal that delivers water from the Colorado River to central Arizona.\nNon-Colorado River surface water is governed by the prior appropriation doctrine.\nPending litigation may rede\ufb01ne and reallocate water rights in Arizona. This case has\nnow been pending for more than 20 years and may take another 5 or 10 years to resolve.\nAs things stand now, surface water is de\ufb01ned as water that sits or \ufb02ows above the earth\nand includes underground water that is the result of the surface water by virtue of per-\ncolation. To be de\ufb01ned as groundwater, the supply must be nonderivative from an iden-\nti\ufb01able surface source. In some cases, it may be possible to sever and transfer surface\nrights within a given watershed.\nGroundwater is controlled by two separate bodies of law. Arizona is divided into\nactive management areas (AMAs) and open areas. Inside the boundaries of these\nAMAs, water can be withdrawn from the ground only for the expansion of municipal\nprovider service areas, by special permits, or by virtue of grandfathered rights. Grand-\nfathered rights were written into the 1980 Groundwater Management Act to protect\nthe rights of historic users while prohibiting new uses. There are three types under\nthe statute: irrigation grandfathered rights, Type 1 nonirrigation grandfathered rights,\nand Type 2 nonirrigation grandfathered rights. Groundwater that is outside active man-\nagement areas may be withdrawn for necessary purposes, though permits to drill must be\nobtained from the Department of Water Resources.\n1 9 5\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nexempt domestic well\nacre-foot\nactive management area\nasbestos\nbrown\ufb01elds\nCentral Arizona Project\nclandestine drug laboratory\nColorado River water\nComprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation, and\nLiability Act (CERCLA)\nelectromagnetic \ufb01eld\ngrandfathered rights\ngroundwater\ninnocent-purchaser defense\nirrigation grandfathered rights\njoint and several liability\nlead-based paint\nlead-based paint disclosure\nm o l d\nPhase One Environmental Analysis\n",

Each party\nstates his or her terms and intentions in words. A purchase contract and receipt for\ndeposit is an express contract; an oral month-to-month rental agreement is also an ex-\npress contract.\nIn an implied contract, the agreement of the parties is demonstrated by their acts or\nconduct. For example, after a lease expires, if the tenant tenders another month's rent\nand the landlord accepts, then the conduct of the parties implies that they intend to\nextend tenancy.\nIn a bilateral contract, each party gives a promise to perform in exchange for the\nother party's promise of performance. A bilateral contract is a two-sided contract, with\neach side making a promise of performance that is binding upon both parties. Most real\nestate contracts are bilateral contracts\nA unilateral contract is a one-sided contract in which one party makes a promise\nin order to induce a second party to perform. The second party has no obligation to act;\nhowever, if he or she does accept, the \ufb01rst party is obligated to keep the promise. An\noption is an example of a unilateral contract because it is binding only on the maker\nof the option (optionor).\nAn executory contract is a contract that is not yet \ufb01nished (unperformed) and\ntherefore incomplete. If a purchase contract has been accepted and is in escrow, it is con-\nsidered an executory contract.\nAn executed contract is a contract that is completed, meaning both parties have\ncompleted their promises. On the day of closing, when the deed is delivered to the\nbuyer and the buyer delivers payment to the seller, the purchase contract is an executed\ncontract.\nESSENTIALS OF A VALID CONTRACT\nIn order for a contract to be considered valid and enforceable, certain requirements must\nbe ful\ufb01lled;\n(C)\n(O)\nCapacity or state of mind\n\u2022 Offer, acceptance, and noti\ufb01cation\n(also called mutual assent or meeting of minds)\nChapter 15 \u2022 Contract Law\n2 0 1\n(V)\n(L)\n( A )\n(W)\n(S)\n\u2022 \nValid consideration\n\u2022 \nLawful purpose\n\u2022 \nAccurate legal description\n\u2022 \nIn writing\n\u2022 \nSigned by all parties\nThe \ufb01rst four items (COVL) relate to general contract law and the last three (AWS)\napply to contracts that pertain to real estate purchase contracts, which are covered by\nthe Statute of Frauds.\nThe following descriptions of each of these requirements will help you understand\nthe concept of a valid contract.\nCapacity\nIf a court decides that a person is legally insane, that person has no capacity to per-\nform, and any contract entered into by that person is automatically void. On the other\nhand, a person who is insane but not judged so could enter into a contract that could\nbe voidable. In other words, the party who has the limited capacity may void the\nc o n t r a c t\nMinors (people who have not reached age 18) in Arizona can also void a contract a t\ntheir option. For example, if a seller entered into a contract for the sale of a lot and dis-\ncovered that the adjacent land was being developed and would increase the value of her\nlot, and also discovered that the buyer was a minor, the seller cannot declare the contract\nvoid. The buyer, however, could do so.\nA person who was under the in\ufb02uence of liquor or drugs is also considered to lack\nthe capacity to contract. However, the courts may not extend as much sympathy to those\nincapacitated by alcohol or illegal drugs as they would to a person who was under the\nin\ufb02uence of extreme medication.\nA person who acts under duress, which means being coerced into an agreement\nthrough fear or misled trust, will not be held to the contract and the result could be\nrescIssion.\nOffer, Acceptance, and Noti\ufb01cation\nAn offer is the extension of a proposal to enter into an agreement. The person making\nthe proposal or offer is called an offeror. The person considering the offer is the\no ff e r e e .\nThe proposal may be altered through negotiations between the t o parties until a\n\"meeting of the minds\" or mutual assent has been reached. Mutual assent signi\ufb01es\nthe stage of acceptance. Time is of the essence in all contracts, which means contracts\nmust be acted upon either within the time stated on the contract or within a reasonable\ntime period.\nNoti\ufb01cation of acceptance is critical to the effectiveness of a contract. Noti\ufb01cation\nof the acceptance requires the same type of communication as the offer. If the offer\nwas mailed, the accepted offer's being deposited into the U.S. mail constitutes\nacceptance.\nIn real estate purchase contracts, the salesperson is usually responsible for the com-\nmunication of acceptance or rejection of an offer. An offeror may rescind his offer at any\ntime verbally until the agent has noti\ufb01ed him of acceptance. If a broker is an agent of the\nbuyer, notice to the agent is deemed to be notice to the buyer because the buyer's agent\nrepresents him in the offer.\n",

The estate of the oferee\n(seller) is bound to the agreement in the case of the seller's death.\nValid Consideration\nConsideration is required to make a contract or agreement enforceable. Consideration\nis the inducement to a contract; speci\ufb01caly it is an act or the forbearance to act or the\npromise to act that is given by one party in return for the act or promise of another.\nConsideration is something of value, such as money, property, personal services, or\nthe promise to perform a speci\ufb01c action. Consideration can be an exchange of\nmoney for property, a promise for a promise, goods for services, and so on. Forbearance\nalso quali\ufb01es as consideration, as does \"love and affection.\" Because \"love and affection\"\nhas value, it is a legal type of consideration and is used when property is transferred\nas a gift.\nLawful Purpose\nTo be enforceable in court, a contract must have a lawful purpose or it is void. One\ncannot enter into a contract to perform illegal acts and look to the courts to uphold\nthe provisions of the contract. When a contract for legal purpose or object contains a\nclause that is illegal, that provision may be removed from the agreement, and the\ncourt could enforce the rest of the agreement.\nAccurate Legal Description\nA real estate purchase contract must have an accurate legal description to be considered\nvalid. A legal description is considered adequate if a surveyor can use it to positively\nidentify the parcel of land. In rural areas of Arizona, a rectangular survey description\nis most often used, or a combination of rectangular survey and metes and bounds de-\nscription. In cities and towns, a lot and block (map and plat) subdivision description\nis usually used.\nContracts Must Be Written\nAccording to the Statute of Frauds, all contracts related to real property (with the\nexception of leases for one year of less) must be in writing. The Statute of Frauds\nwas \ufb01rst adopted in England in 1677 and became a part of English Law. The pur-\npose of the Statute of Frauds was to prevent perjury, which is false testimony\nunder oath in a court of law. A party to an oral real estate contract might falsely tes-\ntify in court to accomplish a fraudulent transaction when there is not a written\ndocument.\nThe parol evidence rule, which is part of the Statute of Frauds, says that a doc-\nument must stand on the written word; there can be no additional oral testimony. Oral\ntestimony in a writen contract dispute can be used only to clarify an ambiguous por-\ntion of the document. Oral testimony cannot be used 10 revise the document or to\nchange the meaning or scope of the written contract.\nAl states have adopted a version of the Statute of Frauds. The following table\noutlines what types of contracts are covered (and not covered) under the Statute of\nFrauds:\nChapter 15 \u2022 Contract Law\n203\nCovered by Statute of Frauds\nNot Covered b y Statute o f Frauds,\nMay Be Oral\n\u2022 Listings\n\u2022 Leases of one year or less\n\u2022 Purchase contracts and receipts\n\u2022 General partnership agreements\nfor deposit\n\u2022 Agreements between brokers or\n\u2022 Land contracts\nbetween brokers and their sales-\n\u2022 Options\npeople regarding commission splits\n\u2022 Leases for more than one year\n\u2022 An agreement to solicit certain types\n\u2022 Wills\nof loans\n\u2022 Mortgages\n\u2022 An agreement to sell personal\n\u2022 Trust deeds\nproperty for less than $500\n\u2022 Promissory notes\n\u2022 Deeds\nSigning of Contracts\nTo be considered a valid contract, the document must be signed by all parties to the\nagreement.\nSTATUS OF CONTRACTS\nContracts are said to be valid, void, voidable, and either enforceable or unenforceable\n(see Figure 15.2). Let's examine the meaning of these words in relation to real estate\ncontracts,\nIf a contract is valid, it will contain all of the essential elements previously dis-\ncussed. A valid contract is legal, enforceable, and binding on all parties.\nIf a contract is void, it means that one or more of the essential elements are missing.\nWithout all of the essential elements, no contract legally exists and, therefore, it is\nunenforceable.\nIf a contract is voidable, it seems valid and enforceable on the surface, but it may be\nvoided by one of the parties. This pertains to minors, mentally incompetent or tempo-\nrarily insane persons, or to persons who were intoxicated or under the in\ufb02uence of\ndrugs. A voidable contract is valid until it is rescinded (cancelled). If the contract is\nnot rescinded, it is considered accepted by rati\ufb01cation.\nFIGURE 15.2\nLegal Effects of Contracts\nLEGAL EFFECTS OF CONTRACTS\n/ VALID\nbinding and enforceable\n/ VOID\nno legal effect, no contract\n/ VOIDABLE\none party can cancel due to fraud, duress, or\nundue in\ufb02uence, but the other side cannot cancel\n/ UNENFORCEABLE\nappears valid, but cannot be enforced in court\n",

On the other hand, she may also continue with the contract and consider it\naccepted by rati\ufb01cation.\nAn unenforceable contract appears valid on the surface, but for some reason cannot\nbe enforced. One example would be an oral contract covered by the Statute of Frauds. In\nan unenforceable contract, neither party can sue to force performance.\nAn enforceable contract is a valid contract with all of the essential elements\n(COVL) present. The contract is binding on all parties and if a party defaults on the\ntenns of performance, enforcement can be brought through a court of law. A valid con-\ntract can become unenforceable because of the Statute of Limitations.\nDISCHARGE OF CONTRACTS\nWhen performance of the agreed-upon actions has been completed, the contract is\ndischarged. If one party has not performed, the contract has been breached, unless\nthe parties agree not to take action. There are certain conditions in which a contract\nis discharged even though complete performance has not been accomplished.\nDischarge\nCompleted Contract\nThe most common discharge of contracts is when the contract is ful\ufb01lled by complete\nperformance of the parties to the contract. Sometimes there is a question as to how\nquickly the parties must complete their performance. To remedy this, contracts often\nset forth a speci\ufb01c time by which the agreed-upon acts must be completed.\nContracts frequently include a \"time is of the essence\" clause, which means that\nthe parties will perform within the limits speci\ufb01ed. Any party not doing so is considered\nin breach o f contract.\nAssignment\nUnless the contract states otherwise, it is permissible to assign the rights, duties, and\nbene\ufb01ts of the contract to a third party without terminating the contract. The third\nparty is called an assignee, and the original party to the contract is the assignor.\nEven though the assignee takes over all rights, the assignor is still liable as contracted\nfor the performance of the original contract.\nNovation\nUnder novation, a new party is substituted for an existing one with the responsibilities\nunder the old contract completely erased. For example, when a real estate purchaser\nassumes a seller's existing mortgage loan, the lender would release the seller, and\nthe buyer would become the mortgagor with the responsibility for the mortgage\ndebt. Under novation, the terms remain the same but with a new contract and\nnew parties.\nAccord and Satisfaction\nAccord and satisfaction occurs when the parties voluntarily agree to complete the con-\ntract, even though all of the terms and conditions have not been met.\nChapter 15 \u2022 Contract Law\n205\nDischarging of a Contract\nPartial Performance\nThe doctrine of part performance is the major exception to the Statute of Frauds, which\nrequires certain contracts, including real estate purchase contracts, to be in writing. Per-\nformance or substantial performance by one party to an oral real estate purchase contract\ncan be suf\ufb01cient to allow the enforcement of the oral contract, even though the agree-\nment is subject to the Statute of Frauds. What de\ufb01nes \"suf\ufb01cient performance\" varies\nfrom one court jurisdiction to another.\nFor example, Roger sold a farm to Burke under an oral agreement for $200,000\nBurke paid Roger $100,000 and agreed to pay $50,000 each year for 2 years.\nBurke made substantial improvements to the farm, paid taxes, and made the \ufb01rst\n$50,000 payment on time. One month before the \ufb01nal S50,000 payment was due,\nRoger declared the contract to be void. In this case, the court would hold for Burke\non the theory that the Statute of Frauds does not apply because there was partial\nperformance.\nSubstantial Performance\nA contract may be considered complete and discharged when a party performs most of\nthe required task. For example, a contractor agreed to build a house and makes minor\ndeviations from the plans but still has complied with most of the provisions. The courts\nwould not \ufb01nd the contractor in breach of the entire contract. They may, however, alter\nthe contract and deduct some of the contract price for the portion not in compliance.\nUnable to Perform\nThe terms of the agreement cannot be enforced if it is beyond the control of the parties\ninvolved. If a painting contractor enters into an agreement to paint a building and then\ndiscovers that \ufb01re has gutted the structure, she is unable to perform. Also, if a party 10 a\ncontract dies and the contract was for personal services, the contract is discharged.\nOperation of the Law\nAn agreement to import or export products to a foreign country could be discharged if\nthe government no longer allowed trade with that country. A contract to construct a\nhome on a site that is suddenly condemned by the city due to contamination could\nnot b e enforced.\nBREACH OF CONTRACT\nBreach of contract occurs when either party defaults on the contract. Rescission, dam-\nages, liquidated damages, or suit for speci\ufb01c performance are actions that may result\nfrom a breach of contract.\nRescission\nRescission is a \"legal remedy of canceling, terminating, or annulling a contract and\nrestoring the parties to their original positions.\"\nRescission can take place due to mistakes, misrepresentation, or fraud. Contracts\ncan also be rescinded unilaterally if a person entered into a contract while under the in-\n\ufb02uence of drugs, alcohol, or under duress. Contracts can also be rescinded by mutual\nagreement of both parties. If this happens, there can be no claims for damages or speci\ufb01c\nperformance suits.\n",

Damages are classi\ufb01ed\nas liquidated damages, actual damages, and punitive damages. An example of liquidated\ndamages is cancellation of a purchase contract by the seller when the buyer defaults and\nacceptance by the seller of the camest money deposit as the damages. When the injured\nparty sues to recover the actual loss due to a breach of contract, the party is said to be\nseeking actual damages. Seeking punitive damages is an attempt to recover amounts\nover the actual damages suffered as compensation for the breach of the contract.\nSuit for Speci\ufb01c Performance\nA suit for speci\ufb01c performance is a judicial action to force a party to carry out the terms\nof the contract. For example, under a valid purchase contract, if a seller suddenly decides\nhe does not want to sell, the purchaser can force him to carry out the terms of the con-\ntract. Likewise, if a buyer has a change of heart after signing a valid purchase contract,\nthe seller can sue the buyer to force the buyer to complete the terms of the contract by\nfollowing through and buying the property.\nStatute of Limitations\nStatutory law allows a speci\ufb01c time limit during which parties to a contract may \ufb01le their\nlegal action to enforce their rights. The time limit varies depending on the legal action\nand the type of contractual terms being enforced. Parties to a contract who do not take\nsteps to enforce their rights within the time limits could lose the rights to do so.\nREAL ESTATE PURCHASE CONTRACTS\nThe purchase contract and receipt for deposit are also known as the sales contract and\ncontract of sale.\nA purchase contract sets out all the details of a sale, states the agreement of buyer\nand seller, and dictates the contents of the deed. A deed is the legal document that trans-\nfers ownership of real property.\nAfter being signed, the purchase contract is binding upon the parties during escrow.\nThe purchase contract also forms the basis for escrow instructions. The signed contract\nis referred to as an executory contract, which means the terms are agreed upon but not\nyet completed.\nAuthority to Prepare Documents\nArticle XXVI of the Arizona constitution gives brokers and salespersons the right to\ndraft, \ufb01ll out, and complete any and all instruments relating to real estate. Real estate\nlicensees are not allowed to charge a fee for this service because they would then be\ndeemed to be practicing law. At no time should a licensee discourage a client from con-\nsulting with an attorney. The fact that brokers and salespersons are allowed to handle the\npurchase contract, escrow instructions, and other documents speeds up the process of\nnegotiation and the closing of the transaction.\nU s e o f Printed Forms\nUsing printed forms also simpli\ufb01es the process of handling and negotiating a listing and\na purchase contract and receipt for deposit.\nLicensees must be thorough when \ufb01lling out forms. Complete information is abso-\nlutely necessary. Al blanks must be \ufb01lled in with the available information or \"N/A\" if\nnot applicable.\nBecause the statute of Frauds requires contracts to be in writing and signed by al\nparties, possible con\ufb02icts ned to be addressed. Any provision that is speci\ufb01c in its terms\nChapter 15 \u2022 Contract Law\n207\nwill take precedence over a more general statement. The use of printed forms also\nrequires some sort of priority to the information added. The general position is that\nhandwritten information takes precedence over printed copy. Also, written amounts\n(three thousand) take precedence over numerals (53,000).\nThe courts wil interpret any errors or incompleteness as the broker's responsibility.\nAlso, remember that in case of litigation, the contract will have to stand on the written\nword due to the parol evidence rule, which does not allow oral evidence to change or\nadd to the terms of the written contract.\nNo speci\ufb01c forms are required for a real estate purchase contract, lease, listing\nagreement, or buyer-broker agreement. However, the most-used forms are those devel-\noped by the Arizona Association of REALTORS\" (AAR). Available for use only by\nAAR members, the forms are available for a small fee at the AAR or the local board\nor association of\ufb01ce (see Figure 15.3).\nSteps in Negotiating a Sale\nA description of the typical steps in negotiating and completing a real estate purchase\ncontract follows:\n1. A prospective purchaser indicates an interest in a particular property. After a\ndiscussion concerning the steps and responsibilities of making an offer, the licensee\nproceeds to complete the purchase contract and receipt for deposit, which constitutes\nthe offer by the potential purchaser.\n2. The negotiation process between buyer and seller continues until there is a meeting of\nthe minds.\n3. All offers to purchase are presented to the seller by the salesperson or broker,\nregardless of merit. The agent does not have the authority to accept, reject, or modify\nan offer. The agent acts in the best interest of his principal but cannot bind the\nprincipal. The agent's main responsibility is to procure a ready, willing, and able\nbuyer. Ready, willing, and able refers to purchasers who have made up their minds\nto buy a given parcel of property and are \ufb01nancially able to do so according to the\nprice and terms agreed upon with the seller.\n4. The seller decides to accept or reject the offer or make a counteroffer. If the seller makes\na counteroffer, the original offer is terminated and the seller becomes the offeror.\ne with \ufb01er and our rote no ot air mere and o\nand the noti\ufb01cation of both parties.\n6. Both parties must initial any changes on the original contract or counteroffer. If there\nare many changes, it may be best to rewrite the whole contract before the offer is\naccepted and the contract is placed in escrow. This practice would remove any chance\nfor misunderstanding between the offeror and the offeree.\n7. A copy of the signed purchase contract is given to the buyer at the time the offer is\nmade. If the seller accepts, she signs the contract, and a copy of the contract is left\nwith the seller.\n8. The licensee then of\ufb01cially noti\ufb01es the buyer of the acceptance by delivering a signed\ncopy to the buyer. If there are counteroffers, a copy is left with each party at each step\nof the negotiation. In addition to these copies, the original must be kept in the\nbroker's \ufb01les for a period of 5 years from the close of the transaction. Rejected offers\nmust be kept for at least l year.\nIf other copies are needed for the lender or escrow, they may be copied from the broker's\noriginal copy. Arizona rules state that a broker must approve every purchase contract\nwritten by himself or his salesperson by initialing it within 5 days.\n",

Contracts may be\nclassi\ufb01ed as express, implied, bilateral, unilateral, executory, or executed.\nIn order for a contract to be considered valid and enforccable, certain requirements\nmust be ful\ufb01lled. These are capacity; offer, acceptance, and noti\ufb01cation; valid consider-\nation; and lawful purpose. A real estate purchase contract also requires an accurate legal\ndescription, must be written, and must be signed by all parties. A person who has limited\ncapacity (insane, minor, under in\ufb02uence of drugs or alcohol, or under duress) may void a\ncontract. An offer is the extension of a proposal to enter into an agreement. Mutual as-\nsent signi\ufb01es the stage of acceptance. Noti\ufb01cation of acceptance is critical and requires\nthe same type of communication as the offer. An offeror may rescind her offer at any\ntime verbally until the agent has noti\ufb01ed her of acceptance. Consideration, the induce-\nment to contract, is something of value, such as money, property, personal services, or\nthe promise to perform a speci\ufb01c action; consideration makes a contract enforceable.\nAlso, to be enforceable a contract must be for a lawful purpose.\nIn addition, a valid real estate purchase contract must have an accurate legal de-\nscription. A legal description is considered adequate if a surveyor can use it to pos-\nitively identify the parcel of land. According to the Statute of Frauds, all contracts\nrelated to real property (with the exception of leases for one year or less) must be\nin writing. The parol evidence rule says that a document must stand on the written\nword.\nContracts may be valid, void, voidable, and either enforceable or unenforceable. A\nvalid contract contains all of the essential elements and is legal, enforceable, and bind-\ning on all parties. If a contract is void, one or more of the essential elements is missing,\nand it is therefore unenforceable. If a contract is voidable, it seems valid and enforce-\nable on the surface, but it may be voided by one of the parties. An unenforceable con-\ntract appears valid on the surface, but for some reason cannot be enforced. An\nenforceable contract is a valid contract with all of the essential elements present.\nWhen performance has been completed, the contract is discharged. If one party has\nnot performed, the contract has been breached, unless the parties agree not to take\naction. The most common discharge of contracts is when the contract is ful\ufb01lled by\ncomplete performance of the parties to the contract. Contracts frequently include a\n\"time is of the essence\" clause, which means that the parties will perform within\nthe limits speci\ufb01ed. Any party not doing so is considered in breach of contract. A con-\ntract may also be discharged, unless the contract states otherwise, by assigning the\nrights, duties, and bene\ufb01ts of the contract to a third party without terminating the con-\ntract. Even though the assignee takes over all rights, the assignor is still liable as con-\ntracted for the performance of the original contract if the assignee does not perform.\nUnder novation, a new party is substituted for an existing one with the responsibilities\nunder the old contract completely erased. Accord and satisfaction occurs when the par-\nties voluntarily agree to complete the contract, even though all of the terms and con-\nditions have not been met.\nThe doctrine of part performance alows the enforcement of an oral contract covered\nby the Statute of Frauds. A contract may be considered complete and discharged when a\nparty performs most of the required task. This is called substantial performance. A con-\ntract may also be discharged if one or more of the parties are unable to perform, or if\noperation of the law makes the contract unenforceable.\nBreach of contract occurs when either party defaults on the contract. Rescission,\ndamages, or suit for speci\ufb01c perfomance are actions that may result from a breach of\ncontract. Rescission is a legal remedy of canceling, terminating, or annulling a contract\nand restoring the parties to their original positions. The party that did not breach the\ncontract can seek damages. Damages are classi\ufb01ed as liquidated, actual, and punitive.\nChapter 15 \u2022 Contract Law\n219\nA suit for speci\ufb01c performance is a judicial action to force a party to carry out the\nterms of the contract. Statutory law allows a speci\ufb01c time limit during which parties\nto a contract may \ufb01le their legal action to enforce their rights. Parties to a contract\nwho do not take steps to enforce their rights within the time limits could lose the rights\nt o do so.\nBrokers and salespersons have the right to prepare documents relating to real estate\nas set forth in Article XXVI of the Arizona constitution.

Title gives\nevidence of the quality, right, and interest in real property, which allows a government,\nindividual, individuals, or legal entity to retain possession of the property.\nCLASSIFICATIONS OF TITLE\nThere are two classi\ufb01cations of title: original title and derivative title.\nOriginal Title\nOriginal title is title held by a country or state. Original title may be gained by conquest,\ndiscovery, cession, or purchase. In the carly history of the United States, land was taken\nin the name of the kings by the early explorers of countries such as Spain, France,\nEngland, and Russia. The land claimed by the United States folowing the Revolutionary\nChapter 16 \u2022 Tille and Transferring Title\nWar is an example of original title by conquest. Examples of original title by purchase\nwould be the Louisiana Purchase, bought by the United States from France, and the pur-\nchase of Alaska from Russia.\nThe Gadsden Purchase was a combination of cession (treaty) and purchase and\ngreatly alfected Arizona. In 1853, the United States purchased 45,535 square miles of\nland in southem New Mexico and Arizona for $10,000,000 from Mexico, in a treaty\nnegotiated by James Gadsden. The purchase added the area south of the Gila River to\nthe Arizona Territory and the area includes Tucson, Bisbee, Douglas, Sierra Vista,\nNogales, and Yuma.\nWhen an original title is conveyed by a state or federal govemment to an individual,\nthe instrument used is called a patent. The transfer of land through the issuance of a\npatent by the sovereign owner is different from a patent issued by the U.S. Patent Of\ufb01ce,\nwhich protects inventions.\nDerivative Title\nDerivative title is title that belongs to an individual or legal entity and is derived from\nthe govemment's original title. Derivative title is typically gained by descent, will. pur-\nchase, or gift.\n223\nPUBLIC NOTICE\nBefore England enacted the Statute of Frauds in 1677, private ownership of land was\nevidenced by its physical possession. A landowner gave notice to everyone of the\nclaim to ownership by visibly occupying the land. When ownership changed, the\nold owner moved off the land and the new owner then visibly occupied the land\nAfter enactment of the Statute of Frauds, ownership transfers were required to\nbe documented with a written deed. Because it was dif\ufb01cult to determine who\nheld the most current deed, questions of land ownership still existed. When the\nholder o f the latest deed also occupied the land, there was no problem, but determi-\nnation of ownership was very dif\ufb01cult when the latest deed holder did not occupy\nthe land.\nThe solution was to create a govemment-sponsored, public recording service that\nallowed a person to record the deed. These public records were open to anyone, and\nan owner could post notice to all that ownership of the land parcel was claimed.\nTwo ways are now available to give notice of ownership rights to land. One is by\nrecording documents in the public records (constructive notice), and the other is by vis\nibly occupying or otherwise making use of the land (actual notice).\nConstructive Notice\nConstructive notice charges the public with the responsibility of examining the public\nrecords to gain knowledge of anyone who might claim a right or interest in the property\nThe legal system assumes that anyone interested in the property has inspected the public\nrecords. Constructive notice is also called legal notice.\nActual Notice\nActual notice is knowledge that is gained from what is seen, heard, read, or observed.\nWhen a prospective purchaser reads a deed transferring property from X to Y, the pur-\nchaser has actual notice of the deed and Y's claim to the property. If a purchaser goes to\nthe property to be purchased and sees someone in possession, the prospective purchaser\nhas actual notice of that person's claim to be there.\n",

This is referred to as inquiry notice, which\nthe law presumes a reasonably diligent person would obtain by making further inquiry.\nExample 1: An individual man is considering the purchase of 40 acres of undevel-\noped desert land. Upon inspecting the land, he observes a dirt road caused by the\nowner's frequent use of the adjoining land to reach the county highway. The law\nexpects the potential owner to make further inquiry because the road may be a\nlegal easement across the land\nExample 2: When buying rental property, the potential buyer is expected to make\ninquiry as to the rights of the occupants. In fact, the potential buyer should deter-\nmine the rights of any occupant of a property to be purchased as he or she may\nhold substantial rights.\nIn summary, anyone claiming an interest or right in real property is expected to make it\nknown either by recorded claim or visible use of the property. Anyone who is acquiring\na right or interest is expected to look in the public records, go to the property to make a\nvisual inspection for claims, and inquire as to the extent of those claims.\nCHAIN OF TITLE\nA chain of title shows the linkage of ownership connecting the present owner to each\nprior owner, all the way back to the original source of title. Generally, the chain starts\nwith the original patent, which grants ownership from the goverment to a private\ncitizen.\nWhen there is a break or gap in the chain, it must be corrected in order to have\nmarketable title. Marketable title is title that a court will consider so free from defect\nthat it will enforce its acceptance by a purchaser. Marketable title can be easily sold to\na reasonably cautious and knowledgeable purchaser. The best evidence of marketable\ntitle is through the issuance of a policy insuring the title. The policy is offered by title\ninsurance companies that search the title of the property back to the origin and estab-\nlish a chain of title.\nTitle Companies\nTitle companies employ examiners who search the documents recorded against a prop-\nerty to make sure that the grantor on one deed was the grantee on the previous deed.\nThey check for acknowledgement, and they check for forgery. They also search for\nliens that have not been released. If there are problems on the title, they can be cor-\nrected through the use of a quitclaim or a suit for quiet title. A suit for quiet title is\na court action that is used when a previous seller is no longer living in the area or\nis deceased.\nAbstract of Title\nAn abstract of title is a summary of all conveyances and legal proceedings affecting\ntite to a parcel of real estate. The abstract of title will show all liens or encumbrances\naffecting the property, An abstractor scarches the county records and other of\ufb01cial sour-\nces, The information is then summarized and arranged in order, along with notations of\nwhere the information was found.\nThe abstract of title does not guarantee the validity of the title; it merely discloses\nitems about the property that are of public record. Abstracts of title are usualy prepared\nfor or by an anomey who is handling the transaction. In some states, title insurance is\nChapter 16 \u2022 Title and Transferring Title\n225\navailable for abstracts. Generally, title abstracts are not used in Arizona because of the\nuse of title insurance.\nThe Torrens System\nThe Torrens system is a legal system for the registration of land ownership. The Torrens\nsystem veri\ufb01es ownership of land and the status of title, including any encumbrances\nexcept tax liens.\nWith the Torrens system, legal title does not pass, nor is the lien effective against the\nproperty, until the conveyance and/or encumbrance is recorded on the certi\ufb01cate. If an\nerror was made through a Registrar of Title, a claim may be made against the state. Title\ninsurance is also available in some cases when using the Torrens system. Under the Tor-\nrens system, an owner receives a certi\ufb01cate of title from the of\ufb01ce of the Registrar of\nTitles. The Torrens system is not used in Arizona.\nPART 2: TRANSFERRING TITLE\nTransferring title is also known as alienation. Alienation is the act of transferring real\nproperty from one person to another. There are four methods of alienation: voluntary\nalienation, involuntary alienation, alienation by descent, and alienation by will. Each\nof these methods will be covered in detail. A full understanding of transfer of title is\nvital to the success of a real estate professional.\nVoluntary alienation is the transfer of ownership with the consent of the owner.\nVoluntary alienation includes selling, exchanging, or giving away the property. Volun-\ntary alienation also includes the dedication of property. Dedication is the voluntary con-\nveyance of private land to the public.\nInvoluntary alienation is the transfer of property ownership without the consent of\nthe owner. Involuntary alienation is accomplished by operation of the law. Types of in-\nvoluntary alienation include:\n\u2022 Mortgage foreclosure\n\u2022 Escheat\n\u2022 Adverse possession\n\u2022 \nTax sale\n\u2022 Judgment\n\u2022 \nEminent domain\nAlienation by will takes place according to the individual's last will and testament,\nwhich is a legal document executed during the individual's lifetime that takes effect\nupon the maker's death for the purpose of distributing his or her estate according to\nhis or her desires\nAlienation by descent occurs when a person dies intestate. A person dies intestate\nwhen he or she dies without a will. The property of the decedent (deceased person) is\ninherited by his or her heirs according to the state laws of descent.\nVOLUNTARY ALIENATION\nIn the sale or gift of real property, the seller or giver is known as the grantor. The\ngrantor is the owner of the property. The purchaser, or receiver, of the property is the\ngrantee. The conveying instrument used for the sale of real property is a deed. A\ndeed i s \"a written legal document by which ownership of real property is conveyed\nfrom one party to another.\" Remember, property rights are known as the \"bundle of\nrights.\" The bundle of rights are the rights that are conveyed in the deed.\n",

The parties who were transferring ownership of\nproperty would gather on the land with their witnesses. With the exchange of the proper\nwords, the grantor would hand the grantee a clod of earth, or in winter when the turf was\nfrozen, a twig from a tree, as a symbolic transfer of ownership.\nBecause it was easy for dishonest grantors to commit fraud through this simple oral\nceremony, the English court system enacted the Statute of Frauds in 1677, which states\nthat all contracts must be in writing. All states in the United States have enacted a ver-\nsion of the Statute of Frauds, In Arizona, the law reads,\n... No estate of inheritance, frechold, or for a term of more than one year, in lands or tene-\nments, shal be conveyed unless the conveyance is by an instrument in writing, subscribed\nand delivered by the party disposing of the estate, or by his agent thereunto authorized by\nwriting\nEvery deed or conveyance of real propery must be signed by the grantor and must be\nduly acknowledged before some of\ufb01cer authorized to take acknowledgements. (ARS 33-401)\nCompetent Grantor\nIn order to convey title, the grantor must be of legal age, 18 years or older. He or she\nmust be of sound mind and deemed mentally competent. There can be no evidence\nthat the grantor was under the in\ufb02uence of drugs, alcohol, or duress.\nDe\ufb01nite Grantee\nTransfer cannot be made to a \ufb01ctitious person or nonexistent corporation. Title may not\nbe transferred to John \"or\" Jane Doe. It may go to one of them or both of them, but not\neither.\nConsideration\nTwo types of consideration can be used in a deed. Valuable consideration means a mon-\netary amount, which is used in the sale of propeny. Good consideration means \" for love\nand affection,\" which is used in the gift of real property.\nChapter 16 \u2022 Title and Transferring Tille\n227\nWords of Conveyance\nThe deed must have words of conveyance, which include the granting clause and the\nhabendum clause.\nGranting Clause\nThe words of conveyance include the granting clause, which transfers the property\nrights along with the grantor's covenants (promises). The wording related to the cove-\nnants varies depending upon the type of deed\nType of Deed\nGranting Clause Phrasing\nGeneral warranty deed\n\"do hereby convey and warrant\"\"\nSpecial warranty deed\n\"remise, release, alienate, and convey\"\nBargain and sale deed\n\"grant, bargain, and sell'\"\nQuitclaim deed\n\"remise, release, and quit claim\"\nHabendum Clause\nThe habendum clause follows the granting clause and states the manner in which the\nproperty is to be held. The habendum clause literally means \"to have and to hold.\" In\nthe case of a joint tenancy deed, it would say, \"the grantor hereby conveys to John and\nMary Merriweather not as tenants in common, and not as community property, but as\njoint tenants with right of survivorship the following described property...\"\nInterest Conveyed\nThe interest conveyed by the grantor must also be speci\ufb01ed in the deed. When a fee sim-\nple estate is being conveyed, there is no need to describe any limitations or quali\ufb01cations\nof the property rights being transferred. A transfer of a life estate requires a limitation in\nthe deed with words similar to. \"John Doe for the duration of his natural life.\"\nLegal Description\nA valid conveyance deed must have an accurate legal description. This can be any one of\nthe three accepted types of legal descriptions, although most properties in an urban set-\nting use the map and plat description. A street address is not acceptable as a legal\ndescription.\nDelivery and Acceptance\nDelivery and acceptance actually transfers title to real property. If the closing is an\nescrow closing, in theory the title company delivers the deed to the grantee on the\ndate of the closing. Escrow \nclosings require recordation of the deed, which the title com-\npany handles for the grantor and grantee. The deed is mailed to the grantee by the county\nrecorder within 2 to 3 weeks, but it is considered delivered to the grantee at the close of\nescrow. The delivery, acceptance, and recordation, along with the buyer's payment of\nfunds, ful\ufb01ll the provisions of the contract, making it an executed contract (that is, a\ncontract that has been completed) as opposed to an executory one (that is, a contract\nwhere something remains to be done by one or more parties).\n",

To be recorded, all\ndeeds must be acknowledged; however, deeds do not have to be recorded to be legal\nin Arizona.\nAn acknowledgement can be done before a person authorized to take acknowledge-\nments, such as a notary public, county recorder, clerk of the court, or judge.\nIf property being sold is owned by a corporation, the person(s) signing for the cor-\nporation must be an of\ufb01cer. The authority to convey property must be granted by a res-\nolution of the board of directors, which also includes in the resolution the authority of\nthe person(s) designated to sign the deed.\nSignatures are always required by the grantor, no matter what type of deed. If the\ntitle is taken as joint tenancy or community property with rights of survivorship, the\ngrantee must sign the deed. If a married couple takes title as tenants in common or as\njoint tenants, they must also sign the deed. This requirement acknowledges that they\nare not taking title as community property.\nExceptions or Reservations\nExceptions or reservations to the title must be listed on the deed. As mentioned\nin Chapter 8, these are called covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs).\nCC&Rs are limitations placed on the use of the property. They are listed on the\ndeed itself. As part of the recorded deed, CC&Rs are enforceable against any future\ngrantees,\nExceptions are limitations on the title, such as easements, mineral rights, or deed\nrestrictions, or other encumbrances on the property.\nReservations are uses that the grantor withholds from the title being conveyed for\npersonal use. The grantor might reserve mineral rights, or, if selling a portion of the land,\nmight reserve an easement for ingress and egress to the portion of land not being sold. A\ngrantor may also reserve a life estate by selling land and reserving a right to live in the\nhouse until his or her death,\nExceptions or reservations are usually listed on the deed by a statement similar to\nthe following:\nSubject to current taxes and other assessments, rescrvations in patents and all casements,\nrights of way, encumbrances, liens, covenants, conditions, restrictions, obligations, and\nliabilities a s may appear o n record.\nTypes of Conveying Deeds\nIn Arizona, three types of deeds are considered conveyance deeds. Though different\nnames are used, often conveyance deeds differ only in their warranties. The three\ntypes of conveyance deeds are:\n1. General warranty deeds\n2, Special warranty deeds\n3, Bargain and sale deeds\nChapter 16 \u2022 Title and Transferring Title\n2 2 9\nGeneral Warranty Deeds\nGeneral warranty deeds contain the greatest number of warranties, which are called\ncovenants (promises). Therefore, general warranty deeds are used most often in\nArizona. They provide the greatest protection to the grantee and impose the greatest\nresponsibility on the grantor.\nThe following are warranties in a general warranty deed:\n\u2022 Covenant of Seisin, which promises that the grantor is the legal owner of the proper-\nty and has the right to convey it.\n\u2022 Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment warrants that the grantee's title is good against third\nparties who might bring court action to establish superior rights.\n\u2022 Covenant Against Encumbrances, in which the grantor promises that the property\nis free from encumbrances, except those listed in the deed\n\u2022 Covenant of Warranty Forever, in which the grantor promises that if title fails at\nany time, he or she will compensate the grantee for the loss.\n\u2022 Covenant of Further Assurance, in which the grantor promises to obtain and\ndeliver any instrument needed in order to make the title good.\nSpecial Warranty Deed\nA special warranty deed offers the same covenants as a warranty deed, except that the\ncovenants are limited to the period of time the grantor was in possession of the property.\nThe words of the granting clause limit all claims and demands made by persons from,\nthrough, or under the grantor. This deed is used by trust departments, new homebuilders,\nor major corporations who wish to sell but only be responsible for claims during their\ntime of ownership.\nBargain and Sale Deed\nA bargain and sale deed provides the least protection to the grantee of any of the con-\nveying deeds. It contains only t o limited warrantics, namely, that the grantor has the\nright to convey the property and has not conveyed it to anyone else, and that the property\nis free of encumbrances, except those listed in the deed. Examples of this deed include\nthe following:\n\u2022 Treasurer's deed (after tax sale)\n\u2022 Sheriff's deed (foreclosure on mortgage)\n\u2022 Trustee's deed (foreclosure on deed of trust)\nQuitclaim Deeds\nA quitclaim deed releases or quits any claim or interest a person has in a property. A\nquitclaim deed offers no warranties. It simply says, \"If I have an interest I give it. If not,\nI give nothing.\"\nQuitclaim deeds are used in after-ownership situations, such as in a divorce. When\none person is awarded sole \nownership of property, the other will quit claim by signing a\ndeed\nClouds on Title\nQuitclaim \ndeeds are also used to clear up clouds on a title. A cloud on the title is an\noutstanding claim or encumbrance, which, if valid, would affect or impair the owner's\ntitle. If there is a defect in a title, an owner or potential owner can go back to the grantor\n",

At that point, because they would\npossibly not have legal title, only an interest in the property, they cannot transfer legal\ntitle. They can only transfer what interest they have.\nAlthough Arizona does not consider quitclaim deeds as conveyance deeds, title\ncompanies will sometimes accept them. This should not be considered a general rule.\nWhen examining and insuring a title, a title company will not insure back past a quit-\nclaim deed.\nQuitclaim deeds are also helpful when a \"straw person\" is used to deed into a joint\ntenancy situation, when the elements of one time and title are needed.\nDisclaimer Deeds\nDisclaimer deeds are used when one spouse of a married couple acquires real property\nand wishes to hold title as separate property from his or her spouse. The spouse must\nexecute and record a disclaimer deed. This places a notice on record that the community\nproperty estate between husband and wife is broken on this real property only. I f a\nspouse does not execute and record a disclaimer deed at the time the real property is\nacquired, that spouse could have a community property interest in the property until a\nquitclaim deed is executed and recorded.\nThe exception to this procedure is when one of the married couple inherits real\nproperty. In that case, the spouse does not need a disclaimer deed. Arizona law provides\nthat inherited real property is sole and separate.\nAf\ufb01davit of Property Value\nIn most cases, a deed must be accompanied by an af\ufb01davit of property value; be\nsigned by the buyers, sellers, or their agents; and be notarized. This document, which\nrecords the sale price of the property conveyed, is used to monitor property values\nfor ad valorem tax purposes throughout the state.\nThe af\ufb01davit contains the names and addresses of buyers and sellers, addresses) of\nthe property, type of deed used, type of property, intended use, method of payment, date\nof sale, and the sales price. See Figure 16.1 for a sample af\ufb01davit.\nSome property transfers are exempt from af\ufb01davits. These exceptions are listed on\nthe reverse side of the af\ufb01davit. They deal with such conveyances as easements, court\norders, mining claims, releases of recorded debt, correcting error on a deed, a partition,\ncorporation mergers, conveyance between family members for nominal consideration,\nand other such transfers.\nINVOLUNTARY ALIENATION\nInvoluntary alienation is the transfer of ownership without the owner's consent. Invol-\nuntary alienation occurs by operation of law. There are two types of involuntary alien-\nation that involve govemment rights:\n\u2022 Escheat (dying without a will and with no heirs)\n\u2022 Eminent domain (taking property for the public welfare by paying fair market\nvalue for it)\nOther types of involuntary alienation involve the result of liens on property:\n\u2022 Tax sale (for delinquent property tax assessment)\n\u2022 Judgments (court action by creditors)\n\u2022 Mortgages or trust deeds in default\nFIGURE 16.1 Af\ufb01davit of Property Value\nAFFIDAVIT OF PROPERTY VALUE\n1.

In general, it is al property other than land, buildings and other\npermanent structures. Personal Property can be tangible or intangible. Examples of tangible personal property are furniture.\nequipment and inventory. Examples in the intangible category are franchises, business licenses, goodwil, and corporate stocks\nand bonds\nChapter 16 \u2022 Title and Transferring Title\n2 3 3\nAdverse Possession\nAdverse possession is also a type of involuntary alienation, but it does not involve a\ngovernment right, nor is it the result of liens on property. The history of adverse\npossession can be traced back to a time before written deeds were used as evidence\nof ownership. For a long time, ownership was acquired through occupation, and this\npractice forms the foundation for what we know today as adverse possession.\nto expel an adverse occupant during the statutory period. Courts demand speci\ufb01c\nproof before they will rule in favor of someone claiming title by virtue of adverse\npossession.\nPersons claiming ownership by adverse possession must prove that they maintained\nactual, visible, continuous, hostile, exclusive, and notorious possession and must have\npublicly claimed ownership to the property.\nrequirements for a speci\ufb01ed period of time. When accumulating the required number\nof years, the adverse claimant may tack on his or her period of possession to that of\na prior adverse occupant.\nHostile possession does not necessarily connote ill will or evil intent; it merely\nsessor can still obtain title by adverse possession.\nA person may acquire title by adverse possession under a mistake of fact. En-\ncroachment is a common source of successful adverse possession claims. Even if an\noccupant had no knowledge that he was encroaching on the owner's property, he\nstill occupied and claimed the property and could acquire title to the property by\nadverse possession.\nColor of Title\nTo claim title by adverse possession in Arizona, a person must have occupied the prop-\nerty for 3 years if he or she has color of title and/or pays the property taxes. Without\ncolor of title or a record of paid property taxes, an adverse occupant must have main-\ntained possession for 10 years. Color of title is a believable appearance of ownership\ninterest, such as an improperly prepared deed proclaiming to transfer title to the occu-\npant, or a claim of ownership by inheritance.\nALIENATION BY WILL\nAlienation by will is a form of voluntary alienation, because the maker of the will took\nthe time to specify who should have his or her possessions after the maker's death. The\nArizona Revised Statutes state the requirements for a valid will.\nA will made during a person's lifetime takes effect upon that person's death. The\ncourts must probate wills. Probate is a legal process by which a court determines the\nassets of the estate and who wil inherit the property of the deceased person. A probate\ncourt also rules on the validity of the will. If the will is upheld, the estate is distributed\naccording to its provisions. The probate cannot be done until a period of 4 months has\npassed after a person's death.\n",

It requires an estate tax waiver, which is a property report by the personal repre-\nsentative of the deceased and a copy of the death certi\ufb01cate.\nAny person who is at least 18 years old can make, alter, or revoke a will. The male\nmaker of a will is called a testator: a female maker is a testatrix. Its maker must sign the\nwill. Wills done on video are recognized in some states but not in Arizona. Arizona does\nrecognize wills written in other states, and they can be probated here.\nThe transfer of real property through a will is called devise. The person who wills\nthe property is the devisor; the receiver of the property is the devisee. The transfer of\npersonal property through a will is a bequest.\nTypes of Wills\nAn attomey usually draws a conventional (or formal) will. The maker and two wit-\nnesses must sign this will. Wills should be dated at the time of the signing. If two or\nmore wills are found, the most recent one will be probated. An amendment to a will\nis called a codicil, which must also be dated and signed. When a new will is written,\nthe old will should be destroyed. Wills should not be altered by simply drawing lines\nthrough the revised portion; they should be rewritten.\nA holographic will is a handwritten will that is signed and dated by its maker. A\nholographic will cannot be typed, but it can be a preprinted form that was \ufb01lled in by\nhand. A holographic will requires no witness\nA nuncupative will is an oral will usually done in the last minutes of a person's life.\nIt is not valid for large amounts of property and Arizona does not provide a way to en-\nforce such a will.\nALIENATION BY DESCENT\nAlienation by descent is considered voluntary. The law provides for an orderly transfer\nof one's property after death when a person dies intestate, which means dying without a\nwill. The law assumes that the person agrees with the laws of intestate succession by not\nmaking a will to change it. A table showing intestate succession for Arizona is included\nin Figure 16.2.\nIntestate Succession\nIntestate succession passes property to the surviving heirs. Property that is held as joint\ntenancy will not pass by succession because it is not inheritable.\nIf a person dies intestate, the probate court will appoint a personal representative.\nThe personal representative acts as the administrator of the estate.\nThe law states that any person who fails to survive the decedent for at least\n120 hours (\ufb01ve calendar days) is considered to have died before the decedent, and\nthe decedent's heirs are determined accordingly.\nPer stirpes distribution is the distribution of intestate property to a group of people\nwho take a share allocated to a deceased ancestor by representing that person.\nExample: A couple has three children, who each have two children. One of the cou-\nple's children dies, leaving a widow and two children. When the grandparents pass\non, the deceased child's share of the grandparents estate wil go to his two children\nper stipes or by representation.\nChapter 16 \u2022 Title and Transferring Title\n2 3 5\nFIGURE 16.2 Table of Intestate Succession\nAPPENDIX 1\nTABLE OF INTESTATE SUCCESSION\nSurviving Relative\nConditions in Computing Share\n(in addition to survival for 1 2 0\nhours)\nShare\n(1) Spouse\n(a) No surviving issue\n(b) Issue all of whom are also\nissue of surviving sopuse\n(c) Issue one or more of whom\nare not also issue of\nsurviving spouse (e.g., issue\nof decedent by prior marnage)\n(a) No surviving spouse\n(a) Al separate property plus\ndecedent's share of\ncommunity property\n(b) Same as (a)\n(c) None of decedent's share\nof community property\n(2) Issue (children, grand-\nchildren, great-\ngrandchildren, etc.)\n\u0410\u041b\n(b) Surviving spouse, issue, all\nof surviving spouse as well as\nof decedent\nc) Surviving spouse, one or more\nissue of decedent not being\nalso issue of the surviving spouse\nNo surviving spouse or issue\nNone\nHalf of separate property and\nall of decedent's half of\ncommunity property\n(3) Parents\n(4) Brothers and sisters\n(5) Nephews and nieces and\ntheir children\nNo surviving spouse, issue, or\nparent\n(a) No surviving spouse, issue,\nor parent, one or more brothers\nand sisters living but one or\nmore dead\nAll\nAll\n(b) Same but all brothers and\nsisters dead\nAll\n(6) Grandparents, aunts, uncles, No surviving spouse, issue, parent,\ncousins, and their issue\nbrother or sister, or issue of brother\nor sister\nAl\nAll\nDivision among\nClass of Heirs\n(a) If all of same degree.\nequal division; if of\nunequal degree, those\nof more remote degree\ntake only by representation\n(b)\n(c) Same as (a)\nEqual shares to both parents\nit living; all to one parent it\nonly one survives\nEqual division\n(a) Division into number of\nshares of living brothers\nand sisters and deceased\nbrothers and sisters whose\nissue survives, issue of any\ndeceased brother or sister\ntaking share by\nrepresentation\n(b) Division into number of\nshares of living nephews\nand nieces and deceased\nnephews and nieces whose\nissue survives, issue of any\ndeceased nephew or niece\ntaking share by\nrepresentation\nEach half to the respeclive\ngrandparents equally if both\nliving, or to one grandparent it\nother is dead, to aunts, uncles,\netc., if both grandparents dead;\naunts, uncles, cousins, etc.,\ntaking equally it of same\ndegree, otherwise those of\nmore remote degree taking by\nrepresentation\n(7) State of Arizona\nNo surviving spouse, issue, parent,\nissue of parents, grandparent, or\nissue of grandparents\n",

Original title is\ntitle held by a country or state. When an original title is conveyed by a state or fed-\neral govemment to an individual, the instrument used is called a patent. Derivative\ntitle is title that belongs to an individual or legal entity and is derived from the gov-\nemment's original title. Derivative title is typically gained by descent, will, purchase,\nor gift\nTwo ways are available to give notice of ownership rights to land. One is by record-\ning documents in the public records (constructive notice), and the other is by visibly\noccupying or otherwise making use of the land (actual notice). Constructive notice,\nalso called legal notice, charges the public with the responsibility of examining the pub-\nlic records to gain knowledge of anyone who might claim a right or interest in the prop-\nerty. Actual notice is knowledge that is gained from what is seen, heard, read, or\nobserved. A person interested in acquinng a property is responsible by law for making\ninquiry of anyone giving actual or constructive notice. This is referred to as inquiry\nnouce.\nA chain of title shows the linkage of ownership connecting the present owner to each\nprior owner. Generally, the chain starts with the original patent. When there is a gap in the\nchain, it must be corrected in order to have marketable title. The best evidence of mar-\nketable title is through the issuance of a policy insuring the title. Title companies search\nthe documents recorded against a property to make sure that the grantor on one deed was\nthe grantee on the previous deed. They also check for acknowledgement, forgery, and for\nliens that have not been released. An abstract of title is a summary of all conveyances and\nlegal proceedings affecting title to a parcel of real estate. Generally, title abstracts are not\nused in Arizona, because of the use of title insurance. The Torrens system is a legal sys-\ntem for the registration of land ownership. The Torrens system is not used in Arizona.\nTransferring title is also known as alienation. Alienation is the act of transferring\nreal property from one person to another. There are four methods of alienation: voluntary\nalienation, involuntary alienation, alienation by will, and alienation by descent.\nVoluntary alienation is the transfer of ownership with the consent of the owner and\nincludes selling, exchanging, or giving away the property. Voluntary alienation also\nincludes the dedication of property, which means the voluntary transfer of property to\na governmental entity. In the sale or gift of real property, the seller or giver is the grantor.\nThe purchaser or receiver of the property is the grantee. The conveying instrument used\nfor the sale of real property is a deed.\nThe essentials of a valid deed include, but are not limited to: must be in writing; must\nhave a competent grantor and a de\ufb01nite grantee; must have words of conveyance, which in-\nclude the granting clause and the habendum clause, and must state the type of interest being\nconveyed. Delivery and acceptance actually transfers title to real property. The deed must\nalso list any exceptions or reservations to the title. These are called covenants, conditions,\nand restrictions (CC&Rs), CC&Rs are limitations placed on the use of the property.\nIn Arizona, there are three types of deeds that are considered conveyance deeds: gen-\neral warranty deeds, special warranty deeds, and bargain and sale deeds. General warranty\ndeeds contain the greatest number of warranties, which are called covenants. General war-\nranty deeds are used most often in Arizona. A special warranty deed offers the same cov-\ncnants as a warranty deed except that they are limited to the period of time the grantor was\nin possession of the property. A bargain and sale deed provides the least protection to the\ngrantee of any of the conveying deeds. A quitclaim deed releases or quits any claim or\ninterest a person has in a property. Quitclaim deeds can be used in a divorce or to clear\nup clouds on a title. Disclaimer deeds are used when one spouse of a married couple\nacquires real property and wishes to hold title as separate propeny from his or her spouse.\nInvoluntary alienation is the transfer of property ownership without the consent of\nthe owner and occurs by operation of law. Two types of involuntary alienation involve\nChapter 16 \u2022 Title and Transferring Title\ngovernment rights: escheat (dying without a will and with no heirs) and eminent domain\n(taking property for the public welfare by paying fair market value for it). A person can\nalso acquire ownership by adverse possession. Adverse possession is a statute of limi-\ntations that prohibits a legal owner from claiming title to land if he or she has done noth-\ning to expel an adverse occupant during the statutory period. Persons claiming\nownership by adverse possession must prove that they maintained actual, visible, con-\ntinuous, hostile, exclusive, and notorious possession, and must have publicly claimed\nownership to the property. To claim title by adverse possession in Arizona, a person\nmust have occupied the property for 3 years if he or she has color of title and/or pays\nthe property taxes. Without these, an adverse occupant must have maintained possession\nfor 10 years. Color of title is a believable appearance of ownership interest.\nAlienation by will takes place according to the individual's last will and testament\nand is also a form of voluntary alienation, because the maker of the will took the time to\nspecify who should have his or her possessions after the maker's death. The courts must\nprobate wills. Probate is a legal process by which a court determines the assets of the\nestate and who will inherit the property of the deceased person. Any person who is at\nleast 18 years old can make, alter, or revoke a will. The transfer of real property through\na will is called devise. The person who wills the property is the devisor, the receiver of\nthe property is the devisee. A conventional (or formal) will is usually drawn by an at-\ntomey. This will must be signed by the maker and two witnesses. An amendment to\na conventional will is called a codicil. A holographic will is a handwritten will that is\nsigned and dated by its maker. A nuncupative will is an oral will usually done in the\nlast minutes of a person's life.\nAlienation by descent occurs when a person dies intestate, which means without a\nwill, and is a form of voluntary alienation. The law provides for an orderly transfer of\none's property after death when a person dies intestate, which means dying without a\nwill. Intestate succession passes property to the surviving heirs. Per stirpes distribution\nis the distribution of intestate property to a group of people who take a share allocated to\na deceased ancestor by representing that person.\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nabstract of title\nconstructive notice\n237\nacknowledgement\nconventional (or formal) will\nactual notice\ncovenants\nadverse possession\ndeed\naf\ufb01davit of property value\nderivative title\nalienation\ndevise\nalienation by descent\ndevisee\nalienation by will\ndevisor\nbargain and sale deed\ndisclaimer deed\nbequest\neminent domain\nchain of title\nescheat\nclouds on title\nexceptions\ngeneral warranty deed\ncolor of title\n",

These recorded instruments and documents provide con-\nstructive notice of an estate, interest or right in land, the transfer of rights in land, or\nthe encumbrance of an interest in land.\nWithin each state, each county has a public recorder's of\ufb01ce that is located in the\ncounty seat. Each county recorder's of\ufb01ce records submitted documents that pertain\nto real property in that county. Therefore, an individual with a deed to property in\nMaricopa County would go to the recorder's of\ufb01ce in Maricopa County for recording.\nLikewise, a party wanting to know about land ownership in Pima County would go to\nthe Pima County recorder's of\ufb01ce to review and examine the public records.\nEarly recordings were usually handwritten accounts of the deed. Later, they were\ntyped and then copied. Al documents presented for recording today must have original\nsignatures and acknowledgements. The signer makes the acknowledgement and the no-\ntary takes the acknowledgement.\n",

Let us assume we have a sale to record that\ninvolves a loan payoff and a new loan. The escrow company positions the document\ni n t h e correct sequence:\n1. The release of the existing mortgage\n2. The deed from the grantor to grantee\n3. The new mortgage lien\nIfany of these documents is out of sequence, it must be recorded in the proper position.\nAf\ufb01davits of Value are \ufb01led with the recorder's of\ufb01ce; they are not recorded.\nErrors\nWhen an error is made in a deed, such as a misspelled name or an inaccurate legal de-\nscription, and the deed has been recorded, the original deed that was recorded can be\ncorrected by lining through the mistake and typing in the correct information. A clause\nis then inserted on the deed stating.\"This deed is being rerecorded for the sole purpose\nof... \" The deed is then rerecorded to re\ufb02ect the correction.\nIf the original deed containing the error cannot be located, a new deed is prepared\nwith the correct information and a clause that states,\"This deed is a corrective deed and\nis being recorded to replace that certain deed between the same parties dated\nrecorded\nat Recorder's No.\n\" The new deed is marked \"corrective\ndeed\" and is then recorded. (This is also known as a deed of con\ufb01rmation.)\nESCROW COMPANIES\nIn your study of recordings and title insurance, an understanding of escrows and escrow\ncompanies will prove helpf\u00fcl.\nA real estate broker, legal counsel, or the parties to the transaction can complete the\nclosing of a real estate transaction. However, almost all real estate closings in Arizona\nare escrow closings, done by escrow companies or escrow divisions of title insurance\ncompanies.\nAn escrow company orders loan payo\ufb01s, prepares escrow instructions, takes sig-\nnatures, disburses funds, and arranges for the recording of documents. Escrow instruc-\ntions, which are generally part of the purchase contract, are documents in which buyers\nand sellers hire escrow companies to work on their behalf. Escrow companies also do\nthe proration and prepare settlement statements, even though the broker is responsible\nfor these reports. At times, escrow companies examine title, but they do not issue the\ntitle insurance. In some cases, the escrow department is a division of a large title insur-\nance company that examines and issues its own policies.\nRegulation\nThe Arizona Department of Financial Institutions (formerly called the State Banking\nDepartment) regulates the escrow departments of escrow and title insurance companies.\nIn the case of escrow companies, the regulating authority requires bonding. Title insur-\nance companies are not bonded.\nThe rates that are charged for escrow service or title insurance are competitive and\nare not set by any regulating agency. Each entity establishes its own rate chart for fees\nand \ufb01les its rate schedule with the Arizona Department of Insurance.\nChapter 17 \u2022 Recording Acts and Title Insurance\n243\nEscrow Instructions\nEscrow instructions are generally included in the purchase contract; but sometimes, the\nescrow company prepares separate instructions. The instructions are the contract through\nwhich the escrow company is employed by the buyer and seller to close the escrow\naccording to their instructions.\nIf there are separate escrow instructions, they should provide the same terms and\nconditions outlined in the original contract to purchase. It is the broker's responsibility\nto make sure they are the same. If there is a discrepancy, the terms of the original pur-\nchase contract will prevail.\nEscrow companies prepare documents as a part of the escrow package, but they may\nnot prepare documents when there is no escrow involved. The escrow company also will\ntake signatures on the closing documents for lenders.\nSome of the larger escrow companies and most title companies operate collection\ndepartments, which collect payments, provide bookkeeping, and act as trustee in seller\ncarried trust deeds or vendor/vendee liens. The companies charge a set-up fee and a\nmonthly collection fee.\nWhen eamest money is deposited with an escrow company, a buyer must sign a\nstatement acknowledging his or her right to have the funds deposited into an interest-\nbearing account. The buyer accepts or rejects that right by signing the forms.\nMarketable Title\nA seller is required to provide clear or marketable title when a property is conveyed.\nMarketable title is title that is reasonably free from risk of legal dispute over possible\ndefects. Marketable title is free from undisclosed encumbrances, has no serious defect, is\nnot dependent on doubtful questions of law, and will not expose the purchaser to the\nhazards of litigation. Lastly, any reasonably well-informed, careful person, acting\nupon business principles and willful knowledge of the facts, could in turn mortgage\nor sell the property at fair market value.\nThe best evidence of marketable title is title that is covered by a title insurance pol-\nicy. The Title Commitment or Preliminary Title Report should be delivered to the buyer\nduring the inspection period to document that marketable title will be delivered by the\nseller.\nTitle Commitment/Preliminary Title Report\nWhen an escrow is opened, the title company wil begin to search the title and prepare a\npreliminary title report or a commitment for title insurance. This will state how the prop-\nerty is to be vested, the quality of the estate conveyed, and any requirements that must be\nresolved, such as back taxes, judgments, or outstanding liens. The buyers should be\ngiven a copy of the report for their inspection. The lender will require a copy of the re-\nport before the loan will be approved.\nWhen buyers or sellers have common names such as Smith, Jones, or Johnson, they\nmay be asked to sign an identity statement. This information is used to determine whether\na judgment that shows on the records against J. Smith could be that particular J. Smith.\nMany times, it will show that the judgment is against someone else who shares that name.\nTITLE INSURANCE\nWhen acquiring real property, the buyer should protect against \ufb01nancial loss due to title\ndefects with title insurance. Even though the preliminary title report indicates marketable\ntitle, there may still be title defects.\nA title insurance policy requires the insurance company to compensate the insured\nfor \ufb01nancial loss, up to the face amount of the policy when the loss results from a title\n",

A title policy also requires the insurance company to defend against claims,\nincluding taking any action necessary to protect the title. The policy protects the insured\nagainst title defects that existed at the time the insured received the title.\nExceptions\nAll title insurance policies contain a list of exceptions. The exceptions are liens, encum-\nbrances, and title problems that the title company will not insure. A title policy will be\nissued only after a title search that reveals al encumbrances of record, as well as other\npossible defects in the title.\nSeveral liens and encumbrances do not affect marketable title, and they are not\nrequired to be cleared in order to transfer ownership at market value. Examples include\ncurrent year real estate taxes, utility casements, deed restrictions, and any other lien or\nencumbrance that the purchaser is willing to accept. On the other hand, mechanic's liens,\njudgment liens, and overdue taxes would need to be resolved before transferring title.\nTitle that is acceptable to the insurance company is called insurable title. The pre-\nmium paid for the policy is a one-time premium paid when the policy is issued.\nTypes of Policies\nThe different types of title insurance policies include owner's policies, lender's policies,\nand leasehold policies.\nOwner's Policy\nAn owner's policy provides protection for the buyer. The face amount of the policy is\ngenerally equal to the purchase price. The coverage amount remains the same for the life\nof the policy. The party that will pay the policy premium should be set forth in the pur-\nchase contract; however, the premium is usually paid by the seller.\nThe insurance in an owner's policy covers the title backward from the time of the\nrecordation of the deed and forward to insure that owner, or the owner's heirs, forever. I n\nother words, if a defect were found 20 years after a property was sold, the title company\nwho issued an owner's policy would still cover the defect.\nOwner's policies are structured in two parts Schedule A and Schedule B. Schedule A\nlists all of the positive coverage. Schedule B lists the exceptions.\nStandard or Extended Coverage\nAn owner's policy can have either standard coverage or extended coverage. A standard\ncoverage owner's policy is the most common policy used in residential conveyance and\nis limited to insurance against\n1. Forged documents of incorrect marital status\n2. Documents signed by incompetent parties\n3. Unmarketable property due to defect of utle\n4. An improperly delivered deed\nAl of these positive assurances are subject to the second page, called Schedule B,\nwhich lists standard exclusions and any speci\ufb01c exclusions found by a search of the\ncounty records. Some of these exclusions could include:\n1 . Defects in title known t o the owner\n2, Unrecorded easements, mechanic's liens, or other liens\n3. Claims or rights not of public record\nChapter 17 \u2022 Recording Acts and Title lasurance\n245\n4. Rights of parties in possession (adverse possession)\n5. Encroachments or anything that could be found by survey\n6. Legal access to the property\nExtended coverage includes all of the coverage of a standard policy, plus additional in-\nsurance against\n1. Anything an inspection of the property might disclose\n2. Discrepancies or con\ufb02icts in boundaries\n3. Unrecorded liens, encumbrances, or leases\n4. Not having legal access\nExtended coverage owners policies are used more often for commercial sales rather\nthan residential sales. Due to the greater coverage they provide, extended coverage pol-\nicies are more expensive than standard coverage policies. Normally, a seller pays for the\nowner's policy. If the buyer requests an extended coverage, it should be a condition of\nthe contract, and parties should agree on who will pay for the additional coverage.\nLender's Policy\nA lender's policy provides protection against defects in the title pledged as security in a\nmortgage or trust deed note. The lender's insurable interest is only to the extent of the\noutstanding loan balance at any given time. As a result, the policy coverage amount\ndecreases as the principal balance due on the note is reduced.\nThe lender's policy insures the lender of his or her security position (that is, \ufb01rst\nposition). Most lenders require an extended coverage policy. The buyer generally\npays the premium for the lender's policy.\nLeasehold Policy\nA leasehold policy provides protection to a tenant or a lender to the tenant against\ndefects in the lessor's title. This policy is usually written to protect a lender when the\nborrower is pledging a leasehold interest instead of a fee simple title.\nAmerican Land Title Association (ALTA)\nThe American Land Title Association (ALTA) is an association of land title compa-\nnies throughout the country. ALTA members use uniform ALTA title insurance forms\ndesigned by the association to achieve standardization within the industry.\nClaims\nThe maximum loss for which the insurance company may be liable cannot exceed the\nface amount of the policy. When a title company makes a payment to settle a claim,\nthe insurance company acquires, by right of subrogation, all the legal remedies and\nrights that the insured party might have against anyone responsible for the settled claims.\nSubrogation is the substitution of one person in the place of another with reference to a\nlawful claim, such as when an insurance company pays a claim and then has the right to\ncollect from the party causing the loss.\nExample: Mr. and Mrs. Cassidy owned a property, and Mr. Cassidy signed his\nname and forged his wife's name on the deed when they sold to Mr. Rogers.\nThe title being \ntransferred to Mr. Rogers was insured because the title insurance\ncompany was not aware of the forgery. Mr. Rogers later sold to Mr. and\n",

Mr. and Mrs. Autry later sold to Mr. and Mrs.\nEastwood on a joint tenancy deed that was insured by a title company. Later,\nMrs. Cassidy told Mr. Eastwood that she never signed the deed; it was forged,\nand their title was defective.\nThe Eastwoods \ufb01led a complaint with the title company, who assured them the\nmatter would be cleared. Because the Eastwoods took title on a warranty deed,\nwhich says the grantor warrants forever, they have the right to ask that the defect\nbe corrected. Because a title policy covered that title, the title company has the\nsame rights through subrogation as the owner and, in fact, would make the\nclaim on behalf of the Eastwoods. And so it continues all the way back between\ntitle insurers and owners until the last title company settles with Mr. Cassidy, who\ncommitted the forgery.\nUnjusti\ufb01ed Claims\nAn owner must have suffered actual loss before a claim can be paid. Examples of unjus-\nti\ufb01ed claims follow:\n\u2022 Title company report fails to show an casement for public utilities over the south eight\nfeet of a lot, and the right to use the casement was never exercised, nor does the\nowner suffer any loss when he sells the property. The owner has no claim.\n\u2022 Property operated as a business in a residential zone is not covered for a loss\nbecause of exceptions in Schedule B excluding govemment regulations or viola-\ntions thereof.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nRecording acts allow certain instruments or documents to be placed in the public record.\nThese recorded instruments and documents provide constructive notice of an estate, in-\nterest or right in land, the transfer of rights in land, or the encumbrance of an interest in\nland. Each county has a public recorder's of\ufb01ce located in the county seat. Each county\nrecorder's of\ufb01ce records submitted documents that pertain to real property in that\ncounty. Documents are recorded in sequence. If a deed containing an error has been\nrecorded, the original deed can be corrected by lining through the mistake and typing\nin the correct information. The deed is then rerecorded to re\ufb02ect the correction. If the\noriginal deed with the error cannot be located, a corrective deed is prepared with the cor-\nrect information.\nAlmost all real estate closings in Arizona are escrow closings, done by escrow com-\npanies or escrow divisions of title insurance companies. An escrow company orders loan\npayoffs, prepares escrow instructions, takes signatures, disburses funds, and arranges for\nthe recording of documents. Escrow companies also do the proration and prepare settle-\nment statements. The Arizona Department of Financial Institutions regulates the escrow\ndepartments of escrow and title insurance companies. The rates that are charged for\nescrow service or title insurance are competitive and are not set by any regulating\nagency, Escrow instructions are generally included in the purchase contract, but some-\ntimes, the escrow company prepares separate instructions. If there are separate escrow\ninstructions, they should provide the same terms and conditions outlined in the original\ncontract to purchase\nA seller is required to provide clear or marketable title when a property is conveyed.\nMarketable title is title that is reasonably free from risk of legal dispute over possible\ndefects. The best evidence of marketable title is title that is covered by a title insurance\npolicy. When an escrow is opened, the title company will begin to search the title and\nChapter 17 \u2022 Recording Acts and Title Insurance\nprepare a Title Commitment or Preliminary Title Report. This report should be delivered\nto the buyer during the inspection period to document that marketable title will be deliv-\nered by the seller.\nWhen acquiring real property, the buyer should protect against \ufb01nancial loss due to\ntitle defects with title insurance. A title insurance policy requires the insurance company\nto compensate the insured for \ufb01nancial loss, up to the face amount of the policy, when\nthe loss results from a title defect. A title policy also requires the insurance company to\ndefend against claims. The policy protects the insured against title defects that existed at\nthe time the insured received the title. All title insurance policies contain a list of excep-\ntions, which are liens, encumbrances, and title problems that the title company will not\ninsure. Several liens and encumbrances do not affect marketable title, such as current\nyear real estate taxes and utility casements. Title that is acceptable to the insurance com-\npany is called insurable title.\nTitle insurance policies include owner's policies, lender's policies, and leasehold\npolicies. An owner's policy provides protection for the buyer, and it can have either stan-\ndard coverage or extended coverage. A standard owner's policy is the most common\npolicy used in residential conveyance and is limited to insurance against forged docu-\nments of incorrect marital status, documents signed by incompetent parties, unmarket-\nable property due to defect of title, and an improperly delivered deed. All of these\npositive assurances are subject to the second page, Schedule B, which lists standard\nexclusions and any speci\ufb01c exclusions found by a search of the county records. An\nextended coverage policy includes all of the coverage of a standard policy, plus addi-\ntional insurance against anything an inspection of the property might disclose, discrep-\nancies or con\ufb02icts in boundaries, unrecorded liens, encumbrances, leases, and not\nhaving legal access. Extended coverage policies are used more often for commercial\nsales rather than residential sales.\nA lender's policy provides protection against defects in the title pledged as secu-\nrity in a mortgage or trust deed note and insures the lender of his or her security po-\nsition. A leasehold policy provides protection to a tenant or a lender to the tenant\nagainst defects in the lessor's title. The maximum loss for which the insurance com-\npany may be liable cannot exceed the face amount of the policy. When a title company\nmakes a payment to settle a claim, the insurance company acquires, by right of sub-\nrogation, all the legal remedies and rights that the insured party might have against\nanyone responsible for the settled claims. An owner must have suffered actual loss be-\nfore a claim can be paid.\n247\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nAmerican Land Title Association\nlender's policy\n(ALTA)\nowner's policy\ncorrective deed\nrecording acts\nescrow company\nstandard coverage\nescrow instructions\nsubrogation\nextended coverage\nleasehold policy\nTitle Report\ntitle insurance\nmarketable title\nTitle Commitment/Preliminary\n",

Except for certain costs re-\nlated to government-backed \ufb01nancing, there is no law or regulation stating who\nshould pay the closing costs. Who will pay is a product of the transaction negotiations\nand should be clearly documented in the purchase contract.\nA description of the typical closing costs follows, separated into buyer costs and\nseller costs, based on the custom for payment responsibility.\nBuyer's Closing Costs\nThe following are closing costs customarily paid by the buyer:\nA loan origination fee is charged by the mortgage company to originate a new loan.\nThe fee is often 1 percent of the loan amount and is almost always paid by the buyer.\nChapter 18 \u2022 Closing the Transaction\nDiscount points are a percentage of the loan amount and are paid by borrowers to\nbuy down the interest rate. The amount of discount charged depends on the avail-\nability of mortgage money and the prevailing interest rate.\nAn appraisal fee is charged for the appraiser's estimate of the fair market value of\nthe property. The appraisal is generally required when the buyer is obtaining new\n\ufb01nancing.\nA credit report fee is charged by a credit bureau to meet the requirements by the\nlender to obtain the \ufb01nancial background of the buyer.\nA tax service fee is charged to order billings that will be mailed to the mortgage\ncompany. It also ensures that the mortgage company will be advised of any new\nassessments and delinquent taxes. This is a one-time charge.\nEscrow fees are charged by the escrow agent for handling the escrow. The fee is\noften split equally between the buyer and the seller.\nRecording/Af\ufb01davit of Value fees applicable to the buyer are charged by the county\nrecorder's of\ufb01ce for recording the documents and \ufb01ling the Af\ufb01davit of Value.\nA lender's policy is usually purchased by the buyer to insure the lender that, among\nother things, the lender's encumbrance is the \ufb01rst lien on the property.\nA hazard insurance premium for dwelling insurance coverage against \ufb01re, storm,\nand other risks is paid by the buyer.\nTax and insurance reserves are required when the purchase is \ufb01nanced with a bud-\nget mortgage. A budget mortgage requires that part of the monthly payment\nincludes additions to the impound account for taxes and insurance. At closing.\nthe lender often requires the buyer to prepay a portion of the required reserve.\nRESPA (discussed below) limits the amount of funds a lender can require the bor-\nrower to put into the impound account.\nAdjusted interest is prepaid interest collected on new loans from the date of funding\nto 30 days prior to the due date of the \ufb01rst regular mortgage payment. This allows\nlenders to conform to their regular amortization schedule.\n251\nSeller's Closing Costs\nThese closing costs are customarily paid by the seller:\nA real estate brokerage commission is the fee paid for the employment of the real\nestate broker for marketing the seller's property. The seller normally pays the bro-\nkerage commission, but in the case of a Buyer-Broker Agreement, the buyer could\npay a portion or all of the commission.\nA prepayment penalty is a fee paid to a lender that is imposed when the existing\nloan is paid before it is due. Certain loans backed by the federal govemment do\nnot allow prepayment penalties.\nEscrow fees are charged by the escrow agent for handling the escrow. The fee is\noften split equally between the buyer and the seller.\nRecording/Af\ufb01davit of Value fees applicable to the seller are charged by the County\nRecorder's of\ufb01ce for recording the documents and \ufb01ling the Af\ufb01davit of Value.\nAn owner's title policy premium is charged by the title insurance company to insure\nthe buyer of marketable title up to the date the conveying instrument is recorded.\nThe seller customarily pays the premium for the title insurance.\nA special assessment payof for any sewer, paving, or other improvement district\nassessment on the property is generally required when the buyer is obtaining a\nnew loan to \ufb01nance the purchase.\n",

The lender usually requires the inspection, and the seller usually\npays the fee.\nProperty tax proration is a cost charged to the seller, unless the seller paid the cur-\nrent year's property tax in advance. See the section on prorations later in this\nchapter.\nAdjusted interest on loan assumptions requires a proration of the interest for the pe-\nnod that the seller owned the property. Because interest is paid in arrears, the daily\ninterest from the date of the seller's last payment to the date of close must be\ncharged to the seller and credited to the buyer.\nREAL ESTATE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES ACT\nEach year, Americans spend nearly SSS billion on loan closing costs, which they some-\ntimes do not fully understand. While the mortgage lending industry has experienced dra-\nmatic changes in the past three decades, the disclosure rules regarding closing costs have\nremained the same.\nHistory of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act\nThe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) was enacted by Congress in\n1974 to ensure that borrowers were provided with more abundant and timelier informa-\ntion on the nature and costs of the settlement process, as well as were protected against\nunnecessarily high settlement costs.\nRESPA's requirements apply to loan transactions involving \"settlement services\"\nfor \"federally related mortgage loans.\" Under the statute, the term settlement services\nincludes any service provided in connection with a real estate settlement. Federally\nrelated mortgage loans is very broadly de\ufb01ned to encompass virtually all purchase\nmoney and re\ufb01nance mortgages. RESPA is administered by the Department of Housing\nand Urban Development (HUD).\nCompliance\nLoans that are covered by RESPA must comply with the following:\n\u2022 The lender must supply the mortgagor with a special booklet, written by HUD,\ntitled Settlement Costs and You.\n\u2022 A good faith estimate of settlement costs must be supplied to the mortgagor at the\ntime of application for the loan or within three business days.\n\u2022 The lender must use a uniform settlement statement developed by HUD, known as\na HUD-/ statement.\n\u2022 No one may charge any fee to the borrower or anyone else for preparation of\nsettlement documents or any disclosures required by the Truth-in-Lending Act.\n\u2022 No one may offer and no one may accept any form of fee, kickback, or thing of\nvalue for the referral of any real estate settlement service.\n\u2022 No seller of property may require a buyer to purchase title insurance covering the\nproperty from any particular title company as a condition of the sale.\n\u2022 Undisclosed af\ufb01liations are prohibited (that is, between the broker and the mortgage\ncompany and/or the escrow company).\n\u2022 The lender is limited in the amount it can require the borrower to put into the\nimpound account.\nChapter 18 \u2022 Closing the Transaction\n253\nImpending Updates\nAs of 2006, HUD has made a commitment to propose changes to the RESPA regula-\ntions that will update, simplify, and improve the disclosure requirements for mortgage\nsettlement costs and help control these costs for consumers. HUD is currently in the\nprocess of gathering information and differing views from industry and consumer\norganizations, as well as other interested parties. Key issues being discussed include\nchanges to the Good Faith Estimate form, disclosure of the compensation to the loan\noriginator, mortgage packages that include interest rate guarantees, and \ufb01xed settlement\ncost prices.\nPRORATION\nProration means allocating taxes, insurance, rents, and interest at settlement to deter-\nmine the amount of money to be charged or credited to the buyer or seller. In Arizona,\nthe day of closing belongs to the buyer. In other words, beginning on the day of closing.\nthe buyer is charged for interest, taxes, and insurance, and the buyer will receive any rent\nincome generated by the property from that day forward.\nCalculating Proration Amounts\nThere are four steps in the computation of the prorated amount:\n1. Compute the cost per day.\n2. Calculate the actual number of days to be prorated.\n3. Multiply the number of days by the cost per day.\n4. Determine whether the amount should be a debit or a credit to the buyer and seller.\nWhen calculating the cost per day and the actual days to be prorated, remember\nthe following:\n\u2022 Use 360 days for a year.\n\u2022 Use 30 days for a month (except when prorating rents, in which case you must use\nthe actual number of days in that month).\n\u2022 The day of closing belongs to the buyer.\nIf an item is paid by the buyer after the settlement date, there is a charge against the\nseller for the prorated portion of the total amount paid that represents the expense for\nthe period from the last payment to the day before closing. The same prorated amount\nis a credit to the buyer, who will pay the total amount due after the settlement date.\nIf the item was paid before the settlement date and the buyer will bene\ufb01t from a\nportion of the payment made, there is a charge against the buyer for the prorated portion\nof the total amount paid that represents the expense for the period from the date of clos-\ning to the end of the prepayment. The same prorated amount is a credit to the seller.\nProration Guidelines\nUse the following guidelines for calculating daily amounts for insurance, rent, taxes, or\ninterest:\n1. Taxes and interest-Divide the annual amount by 360 to \ufb01nd the cost per day.\n2. Insurance-If a 3-year policy, divide by 36 to \ufb01nd the monthly amount. Divide the\nmonthly amount by 30 to \ufb01nd the daily amount\n3. Rents-Divide the monthly rent by the actual number of days in the month.\n",

Insurance is paid in\nadvance and sometimes for 1, 3, or 5 years. The premium per day is usually calculated\non a 360-day year. To prorate a 3- or S-year policy, calculate the yearly, monthly, and\ndaily rate and carry out to three places.\n$525 \u00f7 3 (years) = $175.00\n$175 \u00f7 12 (months) = $14.583\n$14.583 \u00f7 30 (days) = $0.486\no r\n$525 \u00f7 1080 (3 years) = $0.486 per day\nMortgage Interest\nMortgage interest is usually paid in arrears, so at settlement the seller will be charged\nwith the amount due. If the transaction involves a loan assumption, the buyer will re-\nceive a credit for the interest to apply against the next loan payment due.\nExample: A buyer purchased a home on May 8, 2007, and assumed a loan balance\nof $67,350 with a 10.5 percent interest paid to April 1, 2007. What was the buyer's\ncredit at closing?\n1. $67,350 \u00d7 10.5% = $7,071.75 annual interest\n$7,071.75 \u00f7 360 = $19.644 per day\nNow \ufb01nd the exact number of days for settlement:\n2. 30 days = April\n+ 7 days = May\n37 days x $19.644 = $726.83 charged to the seller at settlement\nIn this example, 30 days' interest would be paid to the lender, and 7 days would be cred-\nited to the buyer to apply to the June 1 payment.\nProration Problems\n1. A property has been sold for $75,000. The existing $60,000 \ufb01re insurance policy is\ndated May 13, 2005. The 3-year premium was $388.00. What is the amount charged\nto the buyer if settlement is on April 10, 2007?\n\u2022 Multiply 3 x 360 (the days in a prorated year) to \ufb01nd the number of days in\n3 years. Divide this into a 3-year premium to get daily insurance cost. Calculate\nthe remaining days on the policy using a 30-day month (including the day of\nproration). Multiply rate times the number of unused days.\n2. The taxes on a property for the year are S645.00. If the sale closed escrow on\nSeptember 15, 2007, what would the seller's charge be if the taxes were paid to\nDecember 31, 2006?\n\u2022 Divide the amount of taxes by 360 to \ufb01nd the daily taxes. Determine the number of\nmonths and days the seller had possession and multiply by the daily rate.\n3. A property is sold and settlement is scheduled for June 3. The buyer is assuming a\nloan balance of 524,569.20 with 9 percent interest per annum paid in arrears. The\nChapter 18 \u2022 Closing the Transaction\n255\nmonthly P&l payment is $265.42. If the June I payment has been made, what would\nthe seller's interest proration be?\n\u2022 Multiply the loan balance by the interest rate to compute the annual interest. Then,\ndivide the annual interest by 360 days to get the daily interest expense and\nmultiply that by two days to get the seller's interest proration. The monthly P&l\npayment is not used in the calculation.\nCLOSING STATEMENTS\nA closing statement is a document that accounts for the funds involved in a particular\nreal estate transaction. The closing statement is generally prepared by the escrow\nagent and must contain:\n\u2022 The date of closing\n\u2022 The name of seller and buyer\n\u2022 The location of the property\n\u2022 The name of the person who prepared the statement\nEach party receives a copy of the closing statement. The broker must retain a copy in the\nbrokerage \ufb01les.\nHUD-1 Statement Form\nThe closing statement records the distribution of monies involved in the transaction.\nThere are several formats for closing statements, but most residential closings use a\nHUD-1 statement form because the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act requires\nthat format. A sample HUD-1 statement is included as Figure 18.1. A debit and credit\nstatement is a type of settlement statement used for commercial transaction settlements\nand residential settlements not covered by RESPA.\nPreparing Closing Statements\nThe \ufb01rst step in preparing closing statements is to list all items related to the transaction.\nThe items can involve the following:\n\u2022 Both buyer and seller\n\u2022 The buyer only\n\u2022 The seller only\nItems that affect both the buyer and seller will appear in both statements.\nCredit or Debit\nThe determination of whether an entry is a debit or credit requires an understanding of\nthose terms as used in a closing statement. Debit means that the item will be paid for\nby the person in whose statement that item appears. A debit is an expense of that\nparty. Credit means that the money is received by the person in whose statement it\nappears. A credit is also given for monies paid against an expense obligation in the\ntransaction.\n",

Closing costs customarily\npaid by the buyer include: a loan origination fee, discount points, an appraisal fee, a\ncredit report fee, a tax service fee, escrow fees, recording/Af\ufb01davit of Value fees, a lend-\ner's policy, a hazard insurance premium, tax and insurance reserves, and adjusted inter-\nest. Closing costs customarily paid by the seller include: a real estate brokerage\ncommission, a prepayment penalty, escrow fees, recording/Af\ufb01davit of Value fees, an\nowner's title policy premium, a special assessment payoff, termite inspection, property\ntax proration, and adjusted interest.\nThe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) ensures that borrowers are\nprovided with timely information on the nature and costs of the settlement process, as\nwell as protected against unnecessarily high settlement costs. RESPA's requirements\napply to loan transactions involving \"settlement services\" for \"federally related mort-\ngage loans.\" HUD is currently considering changes to the RESPA regulations that\nwill update, simplify, and improve the disclosure requirements for mortgage settlement\ncosts. Loans that are covered by RESPA must comply with the following (partial list; see\nbody of text for full list):\n\u2022 The lender must supply the mortgagor with a special booklet, written by HUD, titled\nSettlement Costs and You.\nChapter 18 \u2022 Closing the Transaction\n2 5 9\n\u2022 A good faith estimate of settlement costs must be supplied to the mortgagor.\n\u2022 No one may charge any fee to the borrower for preparation of settlement documents.\nProration means allocating taxes, insurance, rents, and interest at settlement to de-\ntermine the amount of money to be charged or credited to the buyer or seller. In Arizona,\nthe day of closing belongs to the buyer. Four steps are used in computing the prorated\namount: (1) Compute the cost per day. (2) Calculate actual number of days to be pro-\nrated. (3) Multiply the number of days by the cost per day. (4) Determine whether\nthe amount should be a debit or a credit to the buyer and seller. Insurance is prorated\nonly when the buyer is assuming the coverage. Mortgage interest is usually paid in ar-\nrears, so that at settlement the seller will be charged with the prorated amount due.\nA closing statement is a document that accounts for the funds involved in a partic-\nular real estate transaction. Each party receives a copy of the closing statement. The bro-\nker must retain a copy in the brokerage \ufb01les. There are several formats for closing\nstatements, but most residential closings use a HUD-1 statement form because the\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act requires that format. A debit and credit statement\nis a type of settlement statement used for commercial transaction settlements and resi-\ndential settlements not covered by RESPA.\nThe \ufb01rst step in preparing statements is to list all items related to the transaction.\nThe items can involve both buyer and seller, the buyer only, or the seller only. Items\nthat affect both the buyer and seller will appear in both statements. As used in a closing\nstatement, debit means that the item will be paid for by the person in whose statement\nthat item appears. A debit is an expense of that party. Credit means that the money is\nreceived by the person in whose statement it appears. A credit is also given for monies\npaid against an expense obligation in the transaction.\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nclosing costs\ncredit\ndebit\ndebit and credit statement\nHUD-1 statement\nproration\nReal Estate Settlement Procedures\nAct (RESPA)\nCHECKING YOUR COMPREHENSION\n1.

Understanding the concepts and principles of\nappraising is key t o your success in real estate, whether as a licensee or as an\ninvestor,\nDe\ufb01nitions\nAn appraisal is an estimate or opinion of value as of a speci\ufb01ed date based on anal-\nysis of factual data. Appraising is not a science. It is sometimes referred to as an art,\nbut you will do wel to remember that it is an opinion of value that is good for that\nday only.\nChapter 19 \u2022 Real Estate Appraisal\n265\nValue means the exchange of present worth for future bene\ufb01ts to the owner of the\nproperty. Most property is purchased with the expectation of appreciation, which is an\nincrease i n value,\nCost is the historical expenditure for the purchase, construction, or improvement of\na property. Cost has nothing to do with present value.\nPrice is the amount asked and the amount paid for property. The listing price is the\namount asked for property. The sales or purchase price is the amount paid for property.\nMany different in\ufb02uences affect price, such as:\n\u2022 Being forced to sell\n\u2022 The terms of the contract\n\u2022 Selling the property to relatives\n\u2022 Being willing to sell only at the listing price\nHere is an example of the difference between value, cost, and price: A three-bedroom\nhome was built in 1945 for $9,500 (cost). The house sold in 1960 for $35,000 (purchase\nprice). The property has been well maintained, is in a good residential location, and in\n2007, its value is $235,000. Value, cost, and price are almost never equal.\nCharacteristics of Value\nThere are four principal characteristics of value: demand, utility, scarcity, and transfer-\nability. To help you remember them, use the acronym D U \u2014 S - T:\nD\nDemand is the need or desire to possess something and having the money\nto ful\ufb01ll that need.\nU\nUtility, or usefulness, is the capacity to satisfy human needs and desires.\nFor example, a shopping center in the middle of an isolated desert would\nnot be very useful or create the same desire for ownership as it would in a\ngrowing section of a city.\nS\nScarcity re\ufb02ects the theory of supply and demand. More scarcity in relation\nto the demand results in an increase in value. If there is an overabundance\nof supply in relation to demand, the value will decrease.\nT\nTransferability. Title that cannot be freely transferred or is restricted has\nlittle value as a purchase. For example, a life tenant can transfer only the\nlife estate, which has a reduced value, because all property rights go to\nthe remainder or reversionary estates upon the termination of the life\nestate.\nTypes of Value\nDepending on the purpose of the appraisal, there are many types of value. The most\ncommon are market value, subjective value, loan value, assessed value, insurable\nvalue, and book value.\nMarket Value\nMarket value is an unemotional, objective price at which a seller would sell and a\nwilling buyer would purchase, \nwith neither party under \nabnormal pressure to act. Mar-\nket value is also described as the highest price a property will bring on the open\n",

In real estate, this is the most commonly\nused type o f value.\nSubjective Value\nSubjective value represents the emotional value of a property's worth to a person, re-\ngardless of cost. The value is created by the amenities or because it ful\ufb01lls the desires\nof the individual. (An amenity is a condition of agrecable living or a bene\ufb01cial in\ufb02uence\nresulting from the location.)\nLoan Value\nLoan value is the value used for establishing the amount of mortgage or trust deed loan\nto be made. Normally, this value would be less than market value.\nAssessed Value\nAssessed value is the value put on the property by the county assessor for the purpose of\ncomputing ad valorem property taxes. Although ad valorem means \"according to\nvalue\" in Latin, the valuation determined by the county assessor for real property\ntaxes seldom represents market value.\nInsurable Value\nInsurable value is used to determine the amount of insurance needed to meet co-insurance\nclause requirements.\nBook Value\nBook value is not used in appraising. Book value is a bookkeeping entry used for the\npurposes of depreciation in the calculation of income tax. It represents cost and capital\nimprovements less depreciation.\nFACTORS INFLUENCING VALUE\nValue is in\ufb02uenced by factors that can be grouped into four main classi\ufb01cations: physical\ncharacteristics, social standards, economic trends, and political regulations.\nPhysical Characteristics\nClimatic conditions. The more favorable the climate, the more valuable the property.\nBefore the development of air-conditioning, the hot climate of certain areas of\nArizona negatively affected property value.\nSize of lot, width, depth, and shape. Comer lots are important for commercial use,\nbut may not increase the value of residential lots.\nTopography. Rolling hills are desirable for residential property. Flat, level land is\nnecessary for industrial, business, and commercial properties.\nSoil conditions. Type of soil is important for agriculture, but for high-rise buildings,\nthe amount of compaction is important. Compaction* is a state where soil particles\n*Real Estate Dictionary \nPocket Guide for Professionals by Charles Jacobus and Nora Olmos\nChapter 19 \u2022 Real Estate Appraisal\nare forced closely together, reducing pore space. Another necessary quality of good\nsoil is its drainage ability, which is determined by a percolation test. A percolation\ntest determines the speed at which standing water is absorbed by the soil. It is im-\nportant to identify the type of soil when building because it can affect the size.\ndepth, and construction of foundations.\nAction of the sun. This is particularly important in commercial properties. Property on\nthe south and west sides of the street is preferable because in warmer climates people\nwalk on the shady side of the streets. The aftemoon sun also has a detrimental effect\non window displays. However, in the modem era of air-conditioned shopping malls,\nthis is no longer a very important factor.\nAny physical hazards that limit ingress, egress, or use of the property are negative\nfactors i n value.\nSocial Standards\nSocial in\ufb02uences on a community or area that can affect market values follow:\nPopulation growth and population density. An increase in a community's popula-\ntion results in more living units per acre of land, including the development of con-\ndominium units and other common interest developments, which generally\nincreases the market value of land. Another result of increased population density\nis the desire of some community members to live in the suburbs, which will increase\nthe demand for and value of suburban housing.\nProximity of schools, shopping centers, churches, and transportation is an important\naspect of property value, as is the availability of cultural or sports centers.\nPopulation mobility is the ability of the population to easily travel throughout the\ncommunity due to a transportation system, such as a mass transit system.\nRecreational opportunities at the individual property or in the immediate neighbor-\nhood or regional areas, such as parks, swimming pools, or tennis courts, all affect an\narea's market values.\nSitus (people's desire for a given area is probably the most important in\ufb02uence on a\nperson's choice of property.\nEconomic Trends\nEconomic trends also play an important role in the value of property. Some aspects of\neconomic trends follow:\nNatural resources. An area without natural resources is not very valuable. Resour-\nces that affect property value include water, mineral deposits, rich soil for agricul-\nture, and timber.\nEmployment opportunities. When unemployment increases and the economy\nbecomes distressed or depressed, there is normally a decrease in the value of prop-\nerty. On the other hand, when a major business moves into the area, employment\nwill increase, and this new business will have a ripple effect on other businesses\nin the area, enhancing the value of property.\nFluctuating interest rates and in\ufb02ation wil also in\ufb02uence value. In the early 1980s,\nhigh interest rates coupled with in\ufb02ation nearly brought the real estate market to a\nstandstill.\nTax rates are not only a concern to residential owners but are also a deciding in\ufb02u-\nence in the location of new businesses.\nReal Estate Dictionary Pocker Guide for Professionals by Charles Jacobus and Nora Olmos.\n267\n",

The lack or cost of credit reduces demand, with a resulting decrease in\nvalues.\nPolitical Regulations\nPolitical regulations can be very instrumental factors in value. A few important regula-\ntions follow:\nZoning. A residential zone now best suited to commercial zoning because of area\ngrowth would be greatly enhanced in value if the zoning were changed.\nBuilding codes, followed strictly, will be an asset to the value of the property.\nPolice and \ufb01re protection. These two city services are essential to the maintenance\nof property values.\nThe area's commitment to solving community problems, such as mass transportation,\ntraf\ufb01c, and pollution, is of great interest to potential property owners. Attitudes toward\nsolution of community problems can have either a positive or negative effect on property\nECONOMIC PRINCIPLES OF VALUE\nThe following economic principles will help you to understand the purpose, techniques,\nand procedures of valuation used by an appraiser in making an appraisal.\nHighest and best use is the most pro\ufb01table use for which land can be used at the\ntime of appraisal: the use that will bring the greatest return. The highest and best use is\nnot necessarily the present use. It is determined by analysis of the community, neighbor-\nhood, site, and improvements. Highest and best use is the primary consideration in the\ndetermination of market value,\nSubstitution sets the maximum value of a property by the cost of equally desirable\nand valuable substitute property in the same area.\nConformity means that a property achieves maximum value when the property rea-\nsonably conforms to the neighborhood. This includes both social and economic confor-\nmity. Conformity should not be confused with monotonous uniformity. However,\nmaximum value is obtained when homes in a neighborhood are similar in size, construc-\ntion quality, and age.\nBalance is not achieved when a property in a given neighborhood is over- or under-\nprinciple implies that balance between net retur on investment and expenses of\nlabor, capital, management, and land have been met.\nAnticipation is value created by expectation of bene\ufb01ts to be collected in the future.\nA person buys income property in anticipation of appreciation. Investors buy raw land in\nanticipation of directional growth in the city.\nChange is a continuous process. Value is based on present and future changes. This\nincludes both social and economic changes. When valuing real estate, economic, social,\nand physical changes of the past and future must be considered.\nCompetition ensues when a business is pro\ufb01table in a given area. The free market\neconomy and the concept of supply and demand alow competitive development in an\narea that is providing a positive yield on the investment. If 1o0 much competition is\nattracted to the area, losses in pro\ufb01ts will result. In valuing investment properties, the\nlimitation on pro\ufb01ts from competition must be considered.\nChapter 19 \u2022 Real Estate Appraisal\nThe principle of increasing and decreasing returns means that as long as money.\nlabor, and management costs invested to improve a property increase retur, the law of\nincreasing retum applies and value rises. If additional funds spent do not produce a pos-\nitive return, the law of decreasing retum applies and value lowers (see previous discus-\nsion of balance).\nContribution is the same principle as increasing and decreasing retums, except that it\napplies to only a portion of the property. One example would be when an owner adds a swim-\nming pool to an apartment complex in order to increase income through higher rent rates.\nThe principle of supply and demand affects real estate values as it does with any\nother marketable object. The principle states that values rise as demand increases or sup-\nply decreases. Values generally fall when supply increases or demand decreases.\nRegression exists when there are properties of different values in a neighborhood.\nThe better property is adversely affected by the poorer properties.\nProgression is the opposite of regression and exists when there is a poorer property\namong more expensive properties. In this instance, the lower-valued home will increase\nin value.\nIntegration, equilibrium, and disintegration are the three stages of a neighborhood\nlife cycle. Integration is the development stage, when the value of a property is increas-\ning. Equilibrium is the static period, when the property reaches its maximum value.\nDisintegration is the period during which the neighborhood declines and the value\ngoes down.\nPlottage is the process of putting several parcels together as one larger parcel to\nachieve the highest and best use and an increase in value. The process of consolidating\nthe separate parcels into one larger parcel is known as assemblage.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is a decrease in value. There are three types of depreciation applied in\nappraising: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence.\nPhysical Deterioration\nPhysical deterioration is the loss of value due to normal wear and tear or to postponed\nmaintenance. Physical deterioration can be either curable or incurable. Considering the\neconomic life of the building helps to decide whether it would pay to \ufb01x the problem.\nEconomic life is the estimated useful life of a building. If it is feasible to do the mainte-\nnance, the deterioration is curable. If the cost to \ufb01x the problem is prohibitive, the deteri-\noration is considered incurable. Examples of physical detenoration include cracks in walls\nor ceilings, settling of foundation, termites, \ufb01xtures that need replacing, or worn carpeting.\nFunctional Obsolescence\nFunctional obsolescence is due to obsolete equipment or outdated architecture or \ufb02oor\nplans. Functional obsolescence can be curable or incurable, depending on the economic\nlife of the building and the expense of remodeling. Examples of functional obsolescence\nare out-of-date plumbing, inadequate electrical wining to handle modern appliances, one\nbathroom in a three- or four-bedroom home, no air-conditioning or central heating, no\nfamily room, and so on.\nEconomic Obsolescence\nEconomic obsolescence is caused by an in\ufb02uence outside the property over which the\nproperty owner has no control. Economic \nobsolescence is usually incurable. Examples\ninclude a prison too close to a residential neighborhood or noise from an airport. A new\nfreeway can result in businesses along the old highway losing value.\n269\n",

Cost approach, also called appraisal by summation\n3. Income approach\nAs we cover each of these approaches in detail, you will understand their particular\nu s e s .\nMarket Data Approach\nThe market data approach is similar to the approach used by licensees or investors when\nlisting residences. As a licensee, you will continually use this approach even though you\nwill not be making a formal appraisal. The licensee completes a Competitive Market\nAnalysis (CMA) using recent sales data on properties sold and the listing prices for com-\nparable properties on the market to assist a seller in determining the listing price.\nThe market data approach, also known as the sales comparison approach, re\ufb02ects\nrecent market trends. However, the appraiser considers comparables only from actual\nsales, whereas the licensee also considers listing prices for comparable properties on\nthe market when completing a CMA. In doing a sales comparison analysis, the subject\nproperty is compared with similar properties in the area that have recently sold. Most\nappraisers use three comparable sales when completing an estimate of value using the\nmarket data approach. The folowing information is compared and adjusted up or down:\n\u2022 Date of sale\n\u2022 Age of the building\n\u2022 Location of the neighborhood\n\u2022 Lot size and terrain\n\u2022 Square footage, number of rooms, and so on\nIf a property is in some way inferior to the subject property, add the estimated difference\nto the comparable sales price. If the comparable property is better than the subject prop-\nerty, subtract the estimated difference from the comparable sales price. Figure 19.1 is an\nexample of the adjustment to comparable sales prices that is made when completing a\nmarket data approach appraisal.\nSingle-Family Homes\nThe market data approach is considered the most reliable of the three approaches to\nvalue, especially when the subject property is in a location where there are comparable\nresales. The market data approach would not be applicable for single-family homes in a\nnew subdivision where there are still signi\ufb01cant properties available from the home-\nbuilder. The market data approach is also used to establish land value.\nCost Approach\nThe cost approach, also called appraisal by summation, estimates today's cost of all\nimprovements, minus all factors of depreciation, plus the valuation of the land using\nthe market data approach.\nThere are two choices for estimating values. One is the reproduction cost, which esti-\nmates the cost by using the original materials and technologies. The second method is called\nreplacement cost, which estimates cost based on using today's materials and technologies.\nChapter 19 \u2022 Real Estate Appraisal\nFIGURE 19.1\nMarket Data Approach\nAppraisal\n271\nAssume that the subject property is a medium quality, 25-year-\nold, three-bedroom home, that h a s a two-car garage. T h e\nsquare footage of the home is 1,300 square feet. The appraiser\nlocates three similar homes that have recently sold in the neigh-\nborhood at fair market prices. All have identic I square footage\nand number of rooms.\nD a t a\nPrice paid\nLocation\nLot size\nOverall\ncondition\nComparables\nComparable A Comparable B Comparable C\n$173,900\n$ 1 7 1 , 5 0 0\n$166,000\nbetter t h a n\nequal to\ne q u a l t o\nsubject\nsubject\nsubject\nproperty\nproperty\nproperty\nequal to\nlarger than\nsmaller than\ns u b j e c t\nsubject\nsubject\nproperty\nproperty\nproperty\nbetter than\ne q u a l t o\nworse than\nsubject\nsubject\nsubject\nproperty\nproperty\nproperty\nDollar Adjustment Factors per the Opinion of the Appraiser\nLocation difference\n$1,000\nLot size difference\n$1,500\nOverall condition difference\n$3,000\nD a t a\nPrice paid\nLocation\nL o t s i z e\nOverall\ncondition\nP r i c e c o m -\nparables would\nhave sold for if\nthey were like\nthe subject\nh o m e\nAdjustments\nComparable A Comparable B\n$173,900\n$171,500\n- 1,000\nComparable C\n$166,000\n- 1,500\n- 3,000\n+ 1,500\n+ 3,000\n$169,900\n$170,000\n$170,500\nSteps in Replacement Cost Approach Method\n1. Estimate the value of the land, plus site improvements such as a driveway, a walkway,\nor landscaping.\n2. Estimate the replacement cost of building. There are three methods that can be used:\n\u2022 Square foot cost method. Take the cost per square foot of a recently constructed\ncomparable building, multiplied by the square footage of the building.\n\u2022 Unit in place method. Estimate the cost of each part of the structure, such as the\ncost of the walls, roof, and plumbing.\n\u2022 Quantity survey method. Itemize and estimate the cost, including labor and\noverhead, of all raw materials needed to replace the structure.\n",

In general, the cost approach is the most\nreliable when there are few comparable sales and the subject property is not income\nproducing.\nIncome Approach\nIncome is the third approach to value. As the title implies, this approach is used for\nincome property. The income approach assumes that income from property establishes\nvalue. The value is computed by converting the right to the future operating income to\nthe valuation amount using a capitalization rate. This approach is used primarily for\napartments, commercial sites, and shopping centers.\nIRV Formula\nChapter 19 \u2022 Real Estate Appraisal\n2 7 3\nFIGURE 19.2\n\"T\" Math Formulas\nT Formula\nINCOME\nPART\n% RATE\nYIELD\nYIELD\nSteps Involved in an Income Approach Appraisal\n1.

The capitalization rate is the rate of retum or yield on\ninvestment. Use a comparable building's net income, divided by sales price of that\nbuilding to get a capitalization rate.\n5. Use the net income divided by the capitalization rate to get the value of the subject\nproperty. Use the \"T\" math formulas for capitalization problems. For capitalization\nproblems, the \"T\" formula is sometimes referred to as \"IRV.\" Both formulas are set\nforth in Figure 19.2.\nThe following table demonstrates how to use the capitalization rate to determine prop-\nerty value.\nGross Annual Income Estimate (rent)\nLess Vacancy - estimated a t 5%\nEffective Annual Gross Income\nExpenses\nReal Estate Taxes\nI n s u r a n c e\nJ a n i t o r\nUtilities\nRepairs\nPainting\nMaintenance\nLegal/Accounting\nManagement\n$75,000\n(3,750)\n$71,250\n$ 9,500\n1,000\n6,000\n15,000\n1,000\n1,200\n1,500\n7 5 0\n3,750\n(39,700)\n$31,550\nANNUAL NET INCOME\nIf the capitalization rate is 10 percent, the property would be valued at $ 315,500\n(S31,550 divided by 10 percent = $315,500).\nThe higher the risk, the greater the capitalization rate.

In each appraisal, al three approaches\nto value are \ufb01gured, even though one would be more appropriate than the others,\nEach approach would produce a different value. Each approach is then analyzed and\nassigned a weighing factor by the appraiser. Appraisers use their judgment as to\nwhich approach is the most relevant.\nThe Appraisal Report\nDepending on the complexity of the appraisal, one of three different kinds of appraisal\nreports can be used. The appraisal letter is used for a very simple, straightforward ap-\npraisal. The appraisal form or checklist is used for most single dwellings or small busi-\nness properties. A sample appraisal form is presented in Figure 19.3. A large project will\nbe reported in the form of a narrative report, which will be lengthy, detailed, and expen-\nsive. However, a narrative report will provide necessary detailed data, charts, and so on\nthat are essential in large transactions.\nGROSS RENT MULTIPLIER\nGross rent multiplier (GRM) is used as a rule of thumb for a quick estimate of value\nbased on the relationship of comparable sales prices to the comparables' monthly rental\nincome. It is not an approach to value. The GRM is often used as a substitute for the\nincome approach for single-family rental units because there is very little information\non single-family rentals.\nFormula\nThis formula is used for calculating the GRM:\nStep 1. Comparable sales price \u00f7 Comparable monthly rental income = GRM\nStep 2. Monthly rental income for the subject property x GRM = Value\nTo establish the GRM for a given neighborhood, compare at least four rentals. Study the\nexample in Figure 19.4.\nLICENSING AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS\nThe Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA)\nestablished the requirement that all \"federally related real estate appraisal\" be performed\nonly by appraisers licensed or certi\ufb01ed by the state in which the real estate is located.\nAppraiser Classi\ufb01cations\nThe three appraiser classi\ufb01cations are described below. Al three of the classi\ufb01cations\nhave speci\ufb01c education, examination, and experience requirements.\nThe Licensed Residential Appraiser classi\ufb01cation applies to the appraisal of non-\ncomplex one to four residential units having a transaction value less than\n$1,000,000, and complex one to four residential units having a transaction value\nless than $250,000.\nThe Certi\ufb01ed Residential Appraiser classi\ufb01cation applies to the appraisal of one to\nfour residential units without regard to transaction value.\nThe Certi\ufb01ed General Appraiser classi\ufb01cation applies to the appraisal of all types of\nreal property.\nFIGURE 19.3 Uniform Residential Appraisal Form\nUNIFORM RESIDENTIAL APPRAISAL REPORT\nCourty\nament Owne\nTa Yar\nter T r e n o\nRE T O 1\nn\no\nn\ne h\no\ne\noot er Project Rume\nI Fee Simpe\nOre el san\nstress\n7 Rapie\nUnder 25%\n)Stm\nshorter\nover 8 men\na n d the facial composison o f the seighborhood a r e n o t appraisal l a c t o r\nacton far afcite matrably of the propertes in the nepteerood pradmily b engleyment and anenthe, encey met sabily, sped te eurtet de. i\nChapter 19 \u2022 Real Estate Appraisal\n275\nDe Com\n9 y   A n n e s  s\nm t e e d\nCenes Tra\n] ta proces\na including sapport for the above t a i o n s r\ne\na\nc\no\nh at w l Ca C o n c w t @ i e o o l o s r e ne f o c o n o o d d e o l o s d ne p r a z e r e s 6 s\nn\nToject edoration for PUDs (l applica). e the derdoes helo le corad el the teams Caren\nererab tal cunter el enta e te suljeci prisci\nindison al Be enprovane\n1181211\n1 0 0 0 0 0\nSartac\nacid Peed Pazard AraMap Dam\nAra Sa, fL\ns Firshed\nASULATION\nToel\ncele\nFuck\nOutta tay\na t a t e Lagen\nAna SafE\nSquan fort el Crons L wing, Are\nCAR STORAGE\nAMENTES\nC 0 0 O 0 0\nl a t i\n1 of can\nAlache\nDeache\ndegracuton phytical, Inchora, und astral, again anded, qualy el cans tochen\nral conditons fuch as, but not fentas l, havardous warta, tic tubianca, (E) pree\nen ln ta engrosements, on the sia, ae la the\nPAGE 1 O\nF 2\n",

Value means the exchange of present worth for future bene\ufb01ts to the owner\nof the property. Most property is purchased with the expectation of appreciation, which\nis an increase in value. Cost is the historical expenditure for the purchase, construction,\nor improvement of a property. Cost has nothing to do with present value. Price is the\namount asked and the amount paid for property.\nThere are four principal characteristics of value: demand, utility, scarcity, and trans-\nferability. The most common types of value are market value, subjective value, loan\nvalue, assessed value, insurable value, and book value.\nMarket value is the highest price a property will bring on the open market, allow-\ning for a reasonable time to sell. In real estate, this is the most commonly used type of\nvalue. Subjective value represents the emotional value of a property's worth to a per-\nson, regardless of cost. Loan value is the value used for establishing the amount of\nmortgage or trust deed loan to be made. Assessed value is the value put on the prop-\nerty by the county assessor for the purpose of computing ad valorem property taxes.\nInsurable value i s used t o determine the amount o f insurance needed t o m e e t co-\ninsurance clause requirements. Book value is an accounting term and is based on his-\ntonical cost.\nValue is in\ufb02uenced by four main factors: physical characteristics, social standards,\neconomic trends, and political regulations. Physical characteristics include climatic con-\nditions, size and shape of lot, topography, soil conditions, action of the sun, and physical\nhazards. Social standards include population growth, population density, population mo-\nbility, proximity, recreational opportunities, and situs. Situs is people's desire for a given\narea. Economic trends include natural resources, employment opportunities, \ufb02uctuating\ninterest rates, in\ufb02ation, tax rates, wage scales, and availability of credit. Political regu-\nlations can be very instrumental factors in value. A few important regulations include\nChapter 19 \u2022 Real Estate Appraisal\nzoning, building codes, police and \ufb01re protection, and the attitude toward solution of\ncommunity problems.\nEconomic principles of value assist an appraiser in making an appraisal. These prin-\nciples are described fully in the body of the text. Some of the principles include confor-\nmity, substitution, balance, progression, and regression.\nDepreciation is a decrease in value. There are three types of depreciation applied in\nappraising: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence.\nPhysical deterioration is the loss of value due to normal wear and tear, or to postponed\nmaintenance. Physical deterioration can be either curable or incurable. Functional obso-\nlescence is due to obsolete equipment or outdated architecture or \ufb02oor plan. Functional\nobsolescence can be curable or incurable, depending on the economic life of the building\nand the expense of remodeling. Economic obsolescence is caused by an in\ufb02uence out-\nside the property over which the property owner has no control. Economic obsolescence\nis usually incurable.\nThe three approaches to value are the market data approach, the cost approach,\nand the income approach. The market data approach re\ufb02ects recent market trends\nand is similar to the approach used by licensees or investors when listing residences.\nThe market data approach is also known as the sales comparison approach; how-\never, the appraiser considers comparables from actual sales only, whereas the li-\ncensee considers listing prices for comparable properties on the market when\ncompleting a Competitive Market Analysis. The market data approach is considered\nthe most reliable of the three approaches to value when appraising a single-family\nThe cost approach, also called appraisal by summation, estimates today's cost o f\nall improvements, minus all factors of depreciation, plus the valuation of the land\nusing the market data approach. There are t o choices for estimating values in the\ncost approach. One is the reproduction cost, which estimates the cost based on\nusing the original materials and technologies. The second method is called replace-\nment cost, which estimates cost based on today's materials and technologies. The\ncost approach is the most reliable when there are few comparable sales and the subject\nproperty is not income producing.\nThe income approach assumes that income from property establishes value. The\nvalue is computed by converting the right to the future operating income to the val-\nuation amount using a capitalization rate. This approach i s used for income\nReconciliation is the last step in the appraisal process, which reconciles the three\napproaches to value. In each appraisal, all three approaches to value are \ufb01gured, produc-\ning three different values. Each approach is then analyzed and assigned a weighing fac-\ntor by the appraiser. The appraiser uses his or her judgment as to which approach is the\nThree different kinds of appraisal reports can be used depending upon the complex-\nity of the appraisal: the appraisal letter, the appraisal form or checklist, or a narrative\nGross rent multiplier (GRM) is used as a rule of thumb for a quick estimate of value\nbased on the relationship of comparable sales prices to the comparables' monthly rental\nincome. It is not an approach to value.\nAl \"federally related real estate appraisals\" may be performed only by appraisers\nlicensed or certi\ufb01ed by the state in which the real estate is located. The three major ap-\npraiser classi\ufb01cations are Licensed Residential Appraiser, Certi\ufb01ed Residential Ap-\npraiser, and Certi\ufb01ed General Appraiser. All three of the appraiser classi\ufb01cations have\nspeci\ufb01c education, examination, and experience requirements. The Appraisal Founda-\ntion serves as the main source of appraisal standards and quali\ufb01cations. The Uniform\nStandards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) covers real estate, personal prop-\nerty, and business appraisal, as well as other topics.\n281\n",

The \ufb01nal money supply, M3, is all M2 money plus\nlarge money deposits (over S100,000) at all depositories. By controlling the supply of\nmoney, the FED can maintain a hold on the rate of in\ufb02ation in this country and its effects\non imports and exports.\nEconomic Stability\nEconomic stability is directly linked to the supply and cost of money. As the supply of\nmoney increases, an increasing level of economic activity will result. Consider the cost\nof money as interest charges on borrowed funds. If the cost of money increases, less will\nbe borrowed. As rates come down, borrowing and economic activity will increase. Ide-\nally, control over the supply and cost of money should be used to create an economic\nbalance. The federal agencies empowered to exercise that control are the U.S. Treasury\nand the Federal Reserve System.\nMember banks and all nationally chartered commercial banks must join the Federal\nReserve System. Each member bank must buy stock in the Reserve district bank, main-\ntain monetary reserves to meet the FED requirements, and clear drafts, electronic fund\ntransfers, and bills of exchange (checks) through the system.\nBanks may borrow from their district bank and pledge their commercial loans as\ncollateral. The FED charges interest on its loans at the FED Funds Rate. Consequently,\nthat rate directly affects the rate the bank must charge its best customers. This rate is\ngenerally referred to as the bank's prime rate. When an interest rate quote is 2 percent\n\"over prime,\" that means that the quote is based on the rate the bank pays when it bor-\nrows money.\nLegislation\nLegislation in the last half-century dealing with money, banks, loans, creditors, and\nconsumers has been proli\ufb01c. For consumers and borrowers, the most signi\ufb01cant legis-\nlation has been the Consumer Protection Act. Passed by Congress in 1968 and subse-\nquently amended, it includes the Truth in Lending Act (Title I) and the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act (Title VII). Other signi\ufb01cant legislation includes the Interstate Land\nSales Full Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act,\nthe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Financial Institutions Reform Re-\ncovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act\nCongress passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) in 1975 to prevent dis-\ncrimination in the loan process. The ECOA requires lending institutions to make loans\non an equal basis to all creditworthy customers without regard to discriminatory factors.\nThe ECOA makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any loan ap-\nplicant in any aspect of a credit transaction. Speci\ufb01cally, creditors cannot deny an appli-\ncant for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Applicant's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, or age (unless\nthe applicant is a minor and therefore does not have the capacity to contract)\n\u2022 Part of the applicant's income is derived from public assistance\n\u2022 The applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Federal Consumer\nCredit Protection Act of which the Truth in Lending Act is a part\nIn addition, lenders and other creditors must inform all rejected credit applicants in\nwriting within 30 days of the principal reason why credit was denied.\nChapter 20 \u2022 Control of Money and Real Estate Finance\n287\nTruth in Lending Act (Regulation Z)\nThe Board of Govemors of the Federal Reserve System is responsible for supervising\nthe Truth in Lending Act. In connection with this responsibility, the FED formulated\nand issued Regulation Z.\nRegulation Z requires lenders to reveal the total cost of loans through a standard\nmeasurement referred to as APR or annual percentage rate. The APR is not the stated\ninterest rate, but it is the effective rate of interest on the loan. It includes all other loan\ncosts and fees paid by the borrower together with the interest that will be paid on the\nloan, stated as an annual percentage of the actual amount of the funds to be received\nby the borrower.\nExample: You borrow $10,000 at a stated interest rate of 9 percent for 1 year. To do\nthis, you sign a note for $10,000; however, the bank charges a fee of 3 points or\n3 percent, so you actually receive only $9,700. After 1 year, you must pay the\nbank S10,900 (S10,000 principal plus $900 of interest). Therefore, our annual per-\ncentage rate (APR) is 12.37 percent (S1,200/S9,700).\nAdvertising\nRegulation Z also applies to advertising the credit terms available in the purchase of a\nhome. The only speci\ufb01c thing that may be stated in the ad is the annual percentage rate,\nwhich must be fully spelled out, not abbreviated as APR. If any other speci\ufb01c credit\nterms are included in the advertisement, the ad must provide full disclosure.\nDisclosure Statement\nFor most loans, lenders must provide borrowers a disclosure statement with a complete\nbreakdown of all loan charges. If the borrower is pledging a principal residence already\nowned as secunty for a loan, the disclosure statement must provide for a right of rescission\nfor the loan transaction. The right to rescind the loan must be exercised by the borrower\nprior to midnight of the third business day following the date the transaction was closed.\nThe 3-day right of rescission does not apply when the loan will \ufb01nance the purchase of a\nnew home or the construction of a dwelling to be used as a principal residence.\nFair Credit Reporting Act\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the action of credit bureaus and the use of\nconsumer credit. If a lender refuses to grant credit or make a loan because of derogatory\ninformation in a potential borrower's credit report, the lender must make that informa-\ntion available for review and provide the potential borrower with the name and address\nof the credit bureau that supplied the information. If requested by the borrower, a credit\nbureau must supply all information included in that person's credit \ufb01le. A person has the\nright to have an erroneous credit report corrected. Further, the Act limits access to a\nperson's credit \ufb01le.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Community Reinvestment Act was passed to help prevent redlining and discrim-\nination by lenders. The Act is designed to ensure that banks \"meet the credit needs o f\nthe community\" in which they conduct their lending business. To comply with the Act,\n\ufb01nancial institutions, which are supervised by federal agencies, must make a reasonable\npercentage of loans in their community and immediate business area and must prepare\ncommunity reinvestment statements that report on various details of their lending\nactivities.\n",

It was designed to stabilize the ailing banking system of the time. In an\neffort to reestablish public trust, deposits were insured, \ufb01rst up to $50,000 and now\nup to S100,000. All member banks of the Federal Reserve System are required to\njoin the insurance program. Nonmember banks can request admission and may, if qual-\ni\ufb01ed, join the program.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System/Of\ufb01ce of Thrift Supervision\nThe Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB) was organized in 1932 to bring stabil-\nity to the savings and loan associations. These institutions, typically called \"building\nand loans\" in those days, were primarily formed to use their association members' sav-\nings deposits to fund residential construction loans. Prior to the establishment of FHLB,\nthese savings and loans had little supervision. Bankruptcies and closings took a signif.\nicant toll on American families.\nThe FHLB provided central credit-clearing facilities and established rules and reg-\nulations for members. The amount of interest paid on savings was not regulated by\nFHLB until the 1966 Interest Rate Adjustment Act. This Act gave FHLB the power\nto set maximum rates that could be paid on savings deposits. A major function was\nto provide a market for the member institutions' securities. Members were allowed to\nborrow money from their district bank with no collateral for up to 1 year. Long-tenm\nloans, such as real estate \ufb01nancing funded by the institutions, required collateral.\nSome dif\ufb01culties arose from savings and loans that had long-term, low \ufb01xed-rate\nmortgages in their portfolio backed by interest-sensitive deposits. As the high-yield\nmoney market securities became popular, billions of dollars in savings were removed\nfrom the savings and loans and placed in highly competitive private money market\nfunds. This issue, combined with the slowdown of the real estate market in the mid-\nto late 1980s, caused many savings and loans to face serious problems. Many savings\nand loan associations went out of business or were shut down by regulators and, typi-\ncally, those that survived changed their charters to become thrift associations or savings\nbanks. In the late 1980s, the Of\ufb01ce of Thrift Supervision replaced the Federal Home\nLoan Bank System.\nSOURCES OF REAL ESTATE FINANCING\nSources of real estate \ufb01nancing include everything from commercial banks, savings and\nloan associations, and pension funds, to your mother-in-law and next-door neighbor.\nBanks, savings and loans, pension funds, life insurance companies, and credit unions\nare typically highly regulated institutions. On the other hand, mortgage bankers and\nbrokers, real estate investment trusts, limited partnership syndications, endowment\nfunds, private loan companies, and individuals are not greatly restricted in their lending\noperations.\nCommercial Banks and Mutual Savings Banks\nCommercial banks rely on demand deposits, primarily checking accounts, for their\nsupply of available funds for loans. Historically, commercial banks have not been a\nsource of long-term real estate \ufb01nance. Their real estate lending activity tends to be\nshort term, such as construction loans, home improvement loans, and mobile home\nloans. All of these are relatively shon-term, high-yield loans.\nMutual savings banks are mostly located in the Midwest and eastem United States.\nThey are organized as mutual companies, where pro\ufb01ts are distributed to the depositors\nthrough interest or dividends. Arizona does not have mutual savings banks.\nChapter 20 \u2022 Control of Money and Real Estate Finance\n2 8 9\nSavings and Loans\nSavings and loans began with the idea of pooling money for real estate loans. Legend\nhas it that 10 friends each put $1,000 in a pot, and then each member drew a number.\nThe person who drew number one was able to use the money \ufb01rst, then number two,\nnumber three, and so on. Because savings and loans were \ufb01rst referred to as building\nand loans, they may well have evolved this way.\nAccording to the Society of Real Estate Appraisers, the \ufb01rst house in the United\nStates to be \ufb01nanced by a savings and loan association was purchased with a $375 mort-\ngage payable at $4.90 per month, of which $1.90 represented interest and $3.00 principal.\nThe Philadelphia house built in 1831 was estimated to have been purchased for $750.\nThe concept of loaning funds only to members soon faded and loans were made to\nother quali\ufb01ed borrowers. As this happened, the attitude shifted more to serving the de-\npositor, changing from building and loans to savings and loans. By paying their depos-\nitors compound interest, at times on a daily basis, they began to attract a larger number\nof depositors. Savings and loans, which are also called thrifts, began to offer a safe de-\npository for savings as well as high interest rates on their deposits. Eventually, savings\nand loans were able to offer full banking services to everyone.\nSavings and loan associations had more \ufb02exibility than other regulated institutions.\nThrough conventional loans, they could make loans in amounts up to and exceeding\n100 percent of appraised value, but they usually only went as high as 80 percent\nloan-to-value without some form of private mortgage insurance on the loans. Until\nthe savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s, these thrifts were generally the primary\nsource of \ufb01nancing residential real estate.\nLife Insurance Companies\nAlthough the sale of such life insurance products as whole life and term life policies re-\nmains an important part of the life insurance business, the primary business of life in-\nsurance companies is no longer traditional life insurance but the underwriting of\nannuities-contracts that guarantee a \ufb01xed or variable payment over a given period\nof time. Premiums collected by life insurers are invested primarily in govemment and\ncorporate bonds although a portion is invested in mortgage loans (mostly commercial).\nToday, the total \ufb01nancial assets of life insurance companies exceed $4.3 trillion. Of that\ntotal, S282.7 billion, or 6.45 percent, is invested in mortgage loans.\nBecause the portfolios of life insurance companies are highly skewed toward short-\nterm liquid investments, longer-term mortgage loans \ufb01t well with their efforts to increase\nyields on those portfolios. Mortgage loans made by life insurance companies are primar-\nily very large loans on commercial properties. In order to enhance the pro\ufb01tability of\nthese investments, life insurance companies will take an equity position in the property\nor development. This is called participation \ufb01nancing.\nPension and Retirement Programs\nIn the late 1800s, the American Express Company formed a retirement program for its\nemployees. This pension plan idea found favor with railroad companies and utility com-\npanies. Employees set aside a portion of their eamings in a matching funds program with\ntheir employers. Money was deposited on a regular basis and withdrawn after retire-\nment, so long-term, secure investments such as real estate loans were very popular.\nWhile pension and pro\ufb01t-sharing plans were popular with those who were able to par-\nticipate, plans were not available to most people.\nIn 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\n(ERISA), a complete overhaul of federal pension law. This Act made it possible for\nthe smallest company (that is, a sole proprietor) to have a pension or pro\ufb01t-sharing\nplan. Or, if an individual was an employee of an organization that did not offer a pension\n",

ERISA also provided for the protection of the assets set aside for pension and\nretirement plans through the establishment of the Pension Bene\ufb01ts Guaranty Corpora-\ntion (PBGC).\nToday, these retirement bene\ufb01t plans cover 150 million workers and contain assets\nexceeding S 4 trillion. Real estate and real estate loans are very attractive investments for\nthese plans because of the security and high rate of retum.\nCredit Unions\nCredit unions are similar to the original savings and loans\u2014 they are operated primarily\nfor the bene\ufb01t of their members or depositors. The popularity of credit unions comes\nfrom their ability to pay higher retums and charge lower rates on money borrowed.\nCredit unions now provide a complete variety of banking services, including mortgages\nand short-term home improvement loans.\nMortgage Bankers and Brokers\nGenerally, a mortgage banker borrows money to make loans. This is done by means\nof a warehouse line of credit, usually made available by a bank or savings and loan.\nThe warehouse line is secured by the loans funded through it. The mortgage banker\nkeeps the loans funded by the warehouse line in the \"warehouse\" until an investor pur-\nchases them or they may be packaged and sold in the secondary market. Once the\nfunded loan has been sold, the mortgage banker repays the warehouse line of credit.\nThe mortgage banker continues to service the loan, which means he or she collects\npayments and receives a fee for this service, or the servicing may also be sold in\nthe secondary market.\nUnlike other lenders who keep some loans in their own portfolio, mortgage bankers\nsell all their loans to investors or to the secondary market. Mortgage bankers are the\nmajor source of residential loans.\nA mortgage banker that represents loan originators, such as banks, life insurance\ncompanies, and pension funds, is called a mortgage correspondent. The correspondent\nrepresents the lender in a local community or temitory and is paid a fee for originating,\nprocessing, closing, and servicing loans.\nA mortgage broker processes loans but usually has no funds to loan. Once the bor-\nrower has been quali\ufb01ed and the loan processing has begun, the mortgage broker places\nthe loan with an investor, who funds the loan through an escrow. The mortgage broker\nreceives an origination fee from the borrower, which is usually a percentage of the loan\namount. The loan servicing can be done by the lender (investor), the mortgage broker, or\nan escrow or title company.\nIn Arizona, mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers are required to be licensed by\nthe Arizona Department of Financial Institutions.\nTHE SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET\nThe secondary mortgage market is simply the purchasing and selling of existing mort-\ngages and trust deeds. It involves lenders selling mortgages to other lenders and investors.\nWhat may be called the primary mortgage market relates to loan originators lending\ndirectly to quali\ufb01ed borrowers. While many lenders who originate loans may retain some\nof them in their own investment portfolios, they undoubtedly sell off most of their loan\nproduction in the secondary market.\nLoan servicing, which involves collecting payments from the borrower and passing\nthem along to the investor for a fee, may be separated from the sale of the loan or it may\nbe included. Thus, the original lender may continue to collect the payments from the\nChapter 20 \u2022 Control of Money and Real Estate Finance\nborrower, passing the payments along to the investor after deducting a fee for servicing\nthe loan.\nWarehousing agencies are major buyers of mortgage loans. These agencies purchase\nlarge numbers of mortgage loans in \"pools.\" They use the pools purchased as collateral\nfor their mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are then traded in the securities mar-\nket much like stocks, bonds, or commodities. The following are the major warehousing\nagencies:\n\u2022 Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)\n\u2022 Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)\n\u2022 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)\nFederal National Mortgage Association\nThe Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) is commonly known as Fannie\nMae. Fannie Mae was established in 1938 as a govemment corporation to create a sec-\nondary market for FHA loans. The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) program, which\nwas established in 1934 to help rebuild the economy, was having trouble selling its mort-\ngages to secondary investors on the national level. This meant they could not free up\ntheir money to reinvest in more loans. Therefore, Fannie Mae was established to provide\nstability and standards that would make FHA loans a lower-risk investment. The FHA\nand its loan programs are discussed at length in Chapter 1.\nIn 1938, with $10 million from the Reconstructive Finance Corporation and the au-\nthority to issue notes, Fannie Mae was able to grant direct loans for the construction of\nhousing projects. Because the organization could not sell these loans in the marketplace,\nFannie Mae's excess funds became a source of money for holders of FHA-insured loans.\nFannie Mae guaranteed the success of the FHA program by providing a secondary mar-\nket for the purchase of FHA-insured loans, replenishing necessary investor capital for\nfunding more FHA loans.\nPrivate Corporation\nAn amendment to the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 changed the Fannie\nMae organization from a successful government-owned and controlled corporation to a\nprivate corporation. All treasury-owned stocks were redeemed, and a matching amount\nof common stock was offered to the general public. Fannie Mae is now a pro\ufb01t-making\norganization, with its stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAs a govemment-owned corporation, Fannie Mae was limited to purchasing FHA-\ninsured and VA-guaranteed mortgages. As a privately owned corporation, it may also\npurchase conventional mortgages, as authorized by Congress in 1970.\nPurchasing Mortgages\nFannie Mae buys mortgages on a regular basis through a weekly auction. Mortgage\nbankers, savings and loans, life insurance companies, and other loan originators are\nmajor sellers of mortgages to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae also sells mortgage-backed\nsecurities to investors in order to raise capital for the purchase of mortgage pools.\nThe securities are backed by speci\ufb01c pools of mortgages purchased and held by Fannie\nMae. Fannie Mae guarantees payments of all interest and principal to the holder of the\nmortgage-backed securities.\nWhen Fannie Mae purchases mortgages, a signed servicing agreement allows the\nloan originator to act, for a fee, as servicing agent. This monthly fee is about one-twelfth\nof one-half of 1 percent of the loan balance. This fee creates a considerable income for\nthe originator, depending on the size of his or her portfolio.

Fannie Mae has become one of the largest\npurchasers of mortgages in the secondary market. In 2001, Fannie Mae purchased over\n40 percent of the loans produced in that year. For the year 2005, Fannie Mae purchases\nof lender-originated issues totaled $481.3 billion. In August 2006, their portfolio of\nmortgage loans exceeded S723 billion.\nGovernment Sponsorship\nEven though Fannie Mae is a privately owned corporation, it is still under govemment\nsponsorship. The board of directors has 18 members who serve I-year terms. The Pres-\nident of the United States appoints \ufb01ve members and stockholders elect thirteen.\nGovernment National Mortgage Association\nThe Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) is a govemment corporation\nunder the control of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Ginnie\nMac, as it is called, administers special assistance programs and works with Fannie Mae in\nsecondary market activities. Ginnie Mae does not purchase mortgages. Its function is to\nguarantee the payment of principal and interest on a pool of FHA, Farmer's Home Admin-\nistration (FmHA), or Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) mortgages. Ginnie Mae does\nthis by issuing a security, called a pass-through certi\ufb01cate, to the investor in the pool of\nmortgages. Because Ginnie Mae is a govemment agency, its guarantee is backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the U.S. govemment. Typically, securities dealers who trade in Gin-\nnie Mae securities purchase the securities issued.\nThe Ginnie Mae pass-through certi\ufb01cate is a security interest in a pool of mortgages\nthat provides for a monthly \"pass-through\" of principal and interest payments directly\nto the certi\ufb01cate holder.\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\nThe second major player in the secondary mortgage market is the Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), known as Freddie Mac. The Emergency\nHome Finance Act of 1970, which gave Fannie Mac the power to purchase conven-\ntional loans, authorized the establishment of a new player in the secondary market.\nOriginally created to provide a secondary mortgage market facility for members of\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank System (Savings and Loan Associations), Freddie\nMac's charter has been modi\ufb01ed to include all mortgage lenders. Freddie Mac is\nnow a publicly owned corporation similar to Fannie Mae and listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange. Through the years, Freddie Mac has become the largest pur-\nchaser of conventional loans in the secondary market. During 2005, Freddie Mac\npurchased mortgages totaling $582 billion and retained a portfolio that exceeded\n$1.7 trillion as of August 2006.\nFreddie Mac \ufb01nances its mortgage purchases through the issuance of mortgage\nparticipation certi\ufb01cates (PCs). These guaranteed mortgage securities are sold to the\npublic through securities dealers. Freddie Mac ultimately assumes the risk of borrower\ndefault in respect to these secunties.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nOne important function of the Federal Reserve System (FED) is the control of the supply\nof money. By controlling the supply of money, the FED can maintain a hold on the rate\nof in\ufb02ation in this country and its effects on imports and exports. Economic stability is\ndirectly linked to the supply and cost of money. As the supply of money increases, an\nChapter 20 \u2022 Control of Money and Real Estate Finance\nincreasing level of economic activity will result. The federal agencies empowered to\nexercise the control of money are the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve System.\nMember banks and all nationally chartered commercial banks must join the Federal\nReserve System.\nSome important legislation dealing with money, banks, loans, and so on includes the\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Regulation Z, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and\nthe Community Reinvestment Act. The ECOA prevents discrimination in the loan pro-\ncess. Regulation Z requires lenders to reveal the total cost of loans through a standard\nmeasurement referred to as APR or annual percentage rate. Regulation Z also applies\nto advertising the credit terms available in the purchase of a home. The only speci\ufb01c\nthing that may be stated in the ad is the annual percentage rate, and those words must\nbe fully spelled out. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the action of credit bureaus\nand the use of consumer credit. If a lender refuses to grant credit or make a loan because\nof derogatory information in a potential borrower's credit report, the lender must make\nthat information available for review and provide the name and address of the credit bu-\nreau that supplied the information. The Community Reinvestment Act helps prevent red-\nlining and discrimination by lenders. Financial institutions must make a reasonable\npercentage of loans in their community and immediate business arca\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits up to $100,000.\nAll member banks of the Federal Reserve System are required to join the insurance pro-\ngram. Nonmember banks can request admission and may, if quali\ufb01ed, join the program.\nThe Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB) was organized in 1932 to bring stability\nto the savings and loan associations. But after many problems with savings and loans in\nthe 1980s, the Of\ufb01ce of Thrift Supervision replaced the FHLB. Sources of real estate\n\ufb01nancing include commercial banks and mutual savings banks, savings and loans, life\ninsurance companies, pension and retirement programs, credit unions, and mortgage\nbankers and brokers.\nCommercial banks rely on demand deposits, primarily checking accounts, for their\nsupply of available funds for loans. Historically, commercial banks have not been a\nsource of long-term real estate \ufb01nance. Mutual savings banks, mostly located in the\nMidwest and easter United States, are organized as mutual companies where pro\ufb01ts\nare distributed to the depositors through interest or dividends. Arizona does not have\nmutual savings banks. Until the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s, savings and\nloans (also called thrifts) were generally the primary source of \ufb01nancing residential\nreal estate. The primary business of life insurance companies is now the underwriting\nof annuities. Premiums collected by life insurers are invested primarily in govemment\nand corporate bonds, although a portion is invested in mortgage loans. Mortgage\nloans made by life insurance companies are primarily very large loans on commercial\nproperties. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) made it possible\nfor the smallest company to have a pension or pro\ufb01t-sharing plan. Or, if an individual\nwere an employee of an organization that did not offer a pension plan, then that individ-\nual could fund his or her own Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Real estate and real\nestate loans are very attractive investments for IRA plans because of the security and\nhigh rate of retum. Credit unions operate primarily for the bene\ufb01t of their members\nor depositors. The popularity of credit unions comes from their ability to pay higher\nretums and charge lower rates on money borrowed.\nA mortgage banker borrows money to make loans. Mortgage bankers sell all their\nloans to investors or to the secondary market. Mortgage bankers are the major source o f\nresidential loans. A mortgage broker processes loans but usually has no funds to loan.\nOnce the borrower has been quali\ufb01ed and the loan processing has begun, the mortgage\nbroker places the loan with an investor, who funds the loan through an escrow. The\nmortgage broker receives an origination fee from the borrower. Mortgage bankers and\nmortgage brokers are required to be licensed by the Arizona Department of Financial\nInstitutions.\n293\n",

It involves lenders selling mortgages to other lenders and\ninvestors. Loan servicing involves collecting the payments from the borrower and pass-\ning them along to the investor for a fee. Loan servicing may be separated from the sale\nof the loan or it may be included. Warehousing agencies are major buyers of mortgage\nloans. These agencies purchase large numbers of mortgage loans in \"pools,\" which they\nuse as collateral for their mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are then traded in\nthe securities market. These major warehousing agencies are the Federal National Mort-\ngage Association (FNMA), Govemment National Mortgage Association (GNMA), and\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC).\nThe FNMA is commonly known as \"Fannie Mae.\" ENMA is a privately owned\ncorporation under goverment sponsorship. Fannie Mae was established to create a sec-\nondary market for FHA loans. FNMA buys mortgages on a regular basis through a\nweekly auction. Mortgage bankers, savings and loans, life insurance companies, and\nother loan originators are major sellers of mortgages to FNMA. Fannie Mae also sells\nmortgage-backed securities to investors in order to raise capital for the purchase of mort-\ngage pools. Speci\ufb01c pools of mortgages purchased and held by FNMA back the secur-\nities. Fannie Mae guarantees payments of all interest and principal to the holder of the\nmortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae has become one of the largest purchasers of\nmortgages in the secondary market\nThe GNMA is a govemment corporation under the control of the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae does not purchase mortgages. Its func-\ntion is to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on a pool of FHA, Farmer's\nHome Administration (FmHA), or DVA morgages. Ginnie Mae does this by issuing\na pass-through certi\ufb01cate to the investor in the pool of mortgages.\nThe second major player in the secondary mortgage market is the FHLMC (Freddie\nMac). Freddie Mac has become the largest purchaser of conventional loans in the sec-\nondary market.

The need and ability to borrow money to buy real property has been\nwith us for centuries. Some of the lending or mortgage laws in use today come from\nthe thirteenth or fourteenth century.\nThroughout most of the twentieth century, people in the United States were primar-\nily concerned with acquiring real estate to provide housing for themselves and their fam-\nilies. For most people, paying off the mortgage was an important \ufb01nancial goal. Long-\nterm, \ufb01xed rate mortgages were ideal for this purpose. Newer generations have different\nobjectives, however, they are much more mobile and \ufb02exible in their living arrange-\nments. Today, in the twenty-\ufb01rst century, people are more likely to look at the purchase\nof a home as an investment rather than just a place to live and raise their families. A\ncelebratory ceremony to \"bum the mortgage\" is extremely rare. Today many families\nchoose real estate as a means of investing their excess disposable income.\nHousing and commercial real estate have experienced tremendous growth in the last\n60 years. This growth would not have been possible without mortgage lending. The re-\nsult of this is that a plethora of \ufb01nancial arrangements is available for today's real estate\ninvestors, whatever their \ufb01nancial objectives. To some people, owning property debt-\nfree gives a great feeling of security. To others, it is poor money management.\nFINANCING INSTRUMENTS\nThe \ufb01nancing of real property typically involves the use of a promissory note, along\nwith some type of security instrument, such as note and mortgage, note and deed of\ntrust, or contract for deed.\nThe Promissory Note\nA promissory note is a promise by the maker of the note to pay a speci\ufb01ed amount in\naccordance with speci\ufb01c terms by a certain date.\nThe note itself is a contract. It is the borrower's promise to pay. The maker of the note\nis the payor and the lender is called the payee. A note is personal property and as a ne-\ngotiable instrument can be sold. The note creates the obligation to pay. A note without col-\nlateralization or security is still a note. This is called an unsecured note or signature note.\nEssentials of a Contract\nA note must include the essentials of a contract: competent parties, valid consideration,\nlawful purpose, be written, be signed, and so on. A note also contains the words promise\nto pay, which create a de\ufb01nite legal obligation. In addition, it contains the date of its\norigin and accurate due date for payment. A note must set forth the provisions for the\nrepayment of the loan and, if it includes a balloon payment, when it is due. A note\nmust state the interest rate, whether it is simple or compound, and, of course, the\nmaker or borrower must sign the note.\nAlthough a note may contain several copies of the original, the borrower signs only\none note. The lender holds the note until the loan is satis\ufb01ed. The signer should be aware\nthat each signed note would be a negotiable instrument, and, therefore, notes are never\nsigned in duplicate. Because the note is a promise to pay, a lender may sue for damages\non the note in case of default.\nNegotiable Instrument\nBecause the note is a negotiable instrument, the obligation to pay can be sold by the\nholder of the note without permission of the payor. When a note is sold to a third party,\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\nthe purchaser of the note is known as a holder in due course. The purchaser has all the\nrights of the original holder.\nIt is also possible to have a cosigner (comaker) on a note. This happens many times\nwith \ufb01rst-time buyers who need additional income from another person to qualify for the\npurchase of a property. All signers are individually and collectively responsible for the\nrepayment of the note. This is known as joint and several liability.\nSecurity Instruments\nM o r t g a g e s\nAs a general rule of law, if an obligation to pay (promissory note) is secured by an in-\nterest in real property, then a mortgage has been created. Speci\ufb01cally, a mortgage is a\nwritten instrument by which real property is pledged to secure a debt or obligation: a lien\non real property. Whether it was created intentionally or accidentally, a mortgage can be\nforeclosed only judicially, by \ufb01ling a lawsuit. Deeds of trust are an exception to the gen-\neral rule of law and can be created if the parties follow all the statutory requirements.\nHowever, the lender under a deed of trust must follow the statutory rules, including\n90-day notice of the trustee's sale, publication, posting, and so on to effect a valid non-\njudicial foreclosure. When real property is pledged with a mortgage or deed of trust, the\nreal property has been hypothecated. Hypothecation means to pledge property as secu-\nrity without giving up possession.\nA contract for sale (also known as an agreement for sale or contract for deed o r\nland contract) is also an exception to the general rule and is created when the obligation\nbeing secured is the purchase price of the property, and the seller (not a third party) is the\npayee. In a contract for sale, the seller retains legal title to the property until the buyer\nhas paid the full amount due. Until that time, the buyer holds only equitable title. If a\nbuyer fails to pay the monthly payment (a type of monetary default), a contract for\nsale may be foreclosed nonjudicially. At times, nonmonetary defaults can occur, such\nas a buyer's committing or allowing\"waste\" or failure to insure the property. When\nt o mortgages.\nrepayment and/or default and foreclosure action.\nA mortgage is a contract that includes a pledge of the property granting someone else\nrights in the property. Therefore, some of the terminology is similar to that of a deed, such\nas the granting clause, with the words \"grant,\" \"sell,\" \"bargain,\" or \"convey.\" The\nmortgage documents will also have a legal description and a covenant of seisin, which\nstates that the mortgagor has the right to convey. The mortgage could also have a provi-\nsion for the impounding of taxes and insurance by the lender.\n2 9 9\nProvisions in a Mortgage\nOther provisions that may be included in a mortgage include a maintenance clause, pre-\npayment clause, alienation clause, acceleration clause, defeasance clause, and subordi-\nnation clause.\nA maintenance clause charges the mortgagor with the responsibility to maintain\nand preserve the property to protect the mortgagees' interest in the property. Failure\nto maintain the property is called waste.\nA prepayment clause enables the borrower to prepay the note prior to its due date\nwithout penalty. It also allows the borrower to make monthly payments greater than the\nagreed amount. Because an amortized loan calculates interest on the unpaid balance, this\ncan greatly reduce the term of a loan.\n",

If a borrower added just S25.00 to the\nmonthly payment, the loan would be paid off in 22 years.\nLenders may not want their loans repaid signi\ufb01cantly ahead of time, particularly in a\nperiod of declining interest rates. For this reason, some conventional loans have substan-\ntial prepayment penalties, and some allow for a prepayment of 20 percent of the out-\nstanding loan balance in any given year.\nAn alienation clause is also known as a due on sale clause. Because the lender\n(mortgagee) quali\ufb01ed the original borrower (mortgagor), that borrower does not\nhave the right to convey the property without the lender's approval because the lender's\nsecunty interest could be placed in jeopardy. Any conveyance of title without the lend-\ner's express approval could give the lender the right to accelerate the \ufb01nal maturity date\nand immediately call the entire remaining balance of the note due and payable.\nAn acceleration clause enables the lender to call the loan due and payable in the\nevent of a default. This clause may be evoked because the mortgagor has defaulted\nby not making payments as agreed or by not complying with provisions of the security\ninstrument.\nA defeasance clause states that if the debt is paid by the due date, the lien that the\nlender holds is not valid. Obviously, security is no longer required because the note is paid\noff. However, because mortgages are recorded against the property, the satis\ufb01ed mortgage\nmust be removed from the chain of title. This is done by recording a satisfaction of\nmortgage, or in the case of a trust deed, a Deed of Reconveyance (also called a Deed\nof Release and Reconveyance).\nCertain mortgages or trust deeds may carry a subordination clause. This simply\nmeans that the lender will agree to a lesser position of security and allow another\nperson/lender to place a lien in front of the original lender's. This is more common\nwith seller carry-back agreements (purchase money mortgages).\nTrust Deeds\nTrust deeds have been used i n Arizona as the principal instrument to secure real prop-\nerty since the Arizona Trust Deed Act was passed in 1971. Trust deeds are also used by\nmost of Arizona's neighboring states. Lenders prefer trust deeds because it takes a\nshorter time to foreclose and, if desired by the lender, the lender could elect to treat a\ndeed of trust as a mortgage and foreclose judicially. As in any trust arrangement,\nthree parties are involved: the trustor, the trustee, and the bene\ufb01ciary.\nTRUSTEE\nHolds Bare\nLegal Title\nTRUSTOR\nBorrower\nBENEFICIARY\nLENDER\nThe trustor is the borrower, or the mongagor in a mortgage. The trustor gives bare\nlegal title to the trustee.\nThe trustee acts for both the trustor and bene\ufb01ciary. The trustee can be a member of\nthe bar association, a licensed real estate broker, an escrow agent, or a licensed insurance\nbroker. An exhaustive list of who may be a trustee is contained in Arizona Revised Stat-\nutes 33-803(A). The trustee cannot be a real estate broker involved in the transaction.\nThe trustee holds bare legal title to the property, meaning he or she has the power of\nsale if the borrower defaults. This provision is known as the power of sale clause.\nThe bene\ufb01ciary is the lender or mongagee and will receive bene\ufb01ts from the action\nof the trustee or trustor.\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\nThe execution of a trust deed is quite simple. The trustor conveys limited legal title\nto the trustee. Limited legal title is called power of sale, naked title, or bare title. The\ntrustee has the power to sell the property and foreclose on the trustor if the trustor\ndoes not pay the bene\ufb01ciary as agreed in the trust deed.\nThe trustor makes payments to the bene\ufb01ciary according to the note. When the \ufb01nal\npayment is made, the bene\ufb01ciary noti\ufb01es the trustee that the loan has been paid off.\nThen, the trustee reconveys the naked title to the trustor. This is accomplished by deliv-\nering a Deed of Reconveyance to the trustor.\nIf the trustor defaults, the bene\ufb01ciary instructs the trustee to foreclose according to\nthe laws that govem trust deed foreclosure. These rules will be covered in Chapter 23.\nRecording a trust deed establishes a lien on the property. Recording a Deed of Recon-\nveyance acknowledges that the lien has been paid off.\nContract for Deed\nA contract for deed, also called an agreement for sale or land contract, enables the\nseller to \ufb01nance a buyer by permitting the buyer to make a down payment followed\nby monthly payments. A contract for deed does not have an accompanying promissory\nnote; it is a single, complete \ufb01nancing and installment sales agreement between a buyer\nand seller.\nA contract for deed should not be considered a mortgage or deed of trust, even\nthough a contract for deed has all the same basic characteristics. These include the\npledge of speci\ufb01c property as collateral for the loan, the terms and conditions for the\nloan's repayment, the statement of the borrower's responsibilities, and consequences\nof a default. However, legal title is not conveyed until the last payment is made.\nVendor and Vendee\nThe parties to a contract for deed are known as the vendor (seller) and vendee (buyer).\nThe most signi\ufb01cant feature of this type of transaction is that the vendor does not\ndeliver a deed to the vendee at the closing. Rather, the vendor promises to deliver the\ndeed in the future when the buyer satis\ufb01es the terms of the contract.\nEquitable Title\nDuring the period beginning with the buyer and seller signing the contract and the seller\nsigning the deed, the buyer has equitable title to the property. With equitable title, the\nvendee has the right to occupy the property and has all the rights and obligations of own-\nership. The purchaser's interest can be forfeited in the event of a default, but only if cer-\ntain speci\ufb01ed requirements are followed, including the giving of notices and allowing\nvery speci\ufb01c and sometimes lengthy periods of time (such as 30 days to 9 months) to\ncure the default.\nThe concept of equitable title stems from the fact that a buyer can enforce speci\ufb01c\nperformance of the contract in court to get legal title. Meanwhile, the vendor holds legal\ntitle in name only and without the full bundle of rights.\nThe equitable title that a purchaser holds under a contract for deed can be trans-\nferred by subcontract or assignment. Equitable title can be sold, given away, or mort-\ngaged, and it passes to the purchaser's heirs and devisees upon the purchaser's death.\nREAL ESTATE LOAN CLASSIFICATIONS\nDepending on the needs of the borrower or lender, there are different real estate loan\nclassi\ufb01cations. Some of these include blanket mortgages, open-end mortgages, pack-\nage mortgages, construction loans, purchase money mortgages, hard money loans,\nall-inclusive deeds of trust, adjustable rate mortgages, and more.

When a developer wishes to develop a large tract of land, he or she would pledge\nall the land as collateral with a release clause stating that the lender will release the lot\nthat has been sold with a lump-sum payment, so that clear title may pass to the pur-\nchaser o f the lot.\nOpen-End Mortgage\nAn open-end mortgage enables a borrower to have a preapproved loan available for\nfuture money requirements. These loans are also called equity loans. If a developer\nhas a preapproved loan for $500,000, he can borrow up to that amount, and as the out-\nstanding loan is paid off, borrow even more. These loan advances are called draws.\n(Also see Construction Loan.)\nPackage Mortgage\nA package mortgage includes a lien on both real and personal property included in the\npurchase. This enables a buyer to purchase appliances for relatively no money down and\nat a low rate of interest, even if it is over a much longer period of time.\nConstruction Loan\nA construction loan is also called an interim-\ufb01nancing mortgage and is a form of an\nopen-end mortgage. This loan \ufb01nances the cost of materials and labor for a building\nThe loan is a short-term loan and must be replaced with permanent \ufb01nancing. Because\nthe loan amount is for the entire cost of construction of a building, and a building that\ndoes not exist cannot be secured, the money is paid to the contractor in installments as\nthe construction progresses. The periodic payments are referred to as draws.\nPurchase Money Mortgage or Deed of Trust\nGenerally, a purchase money mortgage or deed of trust refers to any loan, whatever the\nsource, for all or part of the purchase price for the purchase of real property.\nTypically, however, the term is most often used to describe a seller carry-back note.\nThis type of purchase money mortgage or deed of trust is created when the seller accepts\na note secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the property he is selling as security for\nhis equity, which he agrees to accept in installment payments. In other words, the seller\nbecomes the bank, lending his own equity. This is often done when bank rates are high\nand the seller can offer a lower rate. With this type of \ufb01nancing, the security can be a\nmortgage or a trust deed and the buyer has legal title.\nHard Money Loan\nA hard money loan is a mortgage given for money received. The mortgagee is usually a\nprivate lender. Borrowing the equity from your property is a hard money loan.\nWraparound Mortgages\nA wraparound mortgage (wrap), or all-inclusive deed of trust, is a purchase money\ntransaction subject to, but still including, encumbrances to which it is subordinate. Legal\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\ntitle is actually conveyed and title insurance may also be obtained. An all-inclusive trust\ndeed can be created only when the existing liens are assumable. The seller and buyer\nallow existing liens to remain in place while selling the property for a higher amount.\nThe buyer now makes payments on the new, higher, wrap loan amount to the seller,\nwho then makes the payments on the smaller original loans.\nExample: A property sells for S600,000. The seller's existing loans are a \ufb01rst trust\ndeed with a balance of $236,000 at 8 percent and a payment of $2,360 per month,\nand a second trust deed with a balance of $64,000, payable at 10 percent. If the\nbuyer pays $100,000 cash down, the seller's remaining equity of $200,000 can\nbe included in a wrap-around mortgage of $500,000 at 12 percent annual interest.\n$ 600,000\nSales price\n$ 200,000\n- 100, 000\nDown payment\n+ 300,000\n$ 500, 000\nPurchase money loan\n$ 500,000\nSeller's equity\nExisting liens\nTotal wrap loan\nThe seller is collecting 12 percent on S500,000 when her equity is only $200,000.\nTherefore, the seller is making 4 percent over the \ufb01rst lien (bank money) interest\nrate of 8 percent and 2 percent over the interest rate on the second trust deed. The\nseller must continue to make the payments to the \ufb01rst and second lien holders.\nAdjustable Rate Mortgage\nAn adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) results in a sharing between the borrower and\nlender of risks of a \ufb02uctuating interest rate economy. The ARM allows the lender to\nmake interest rate adjustments by referring to a national index, such as the Wall Street\nJournal prime rate, Federal Reserve District Cost of Funds index, U.S. Treasury bills,\nand so on. Whatever the index, it must be readily available for the borrower's inspection\nand outside the control of the lender. ARMs generally include caps on the amount and\nnumber of interest rate adjustments both annually and over the life of the loan. An ARM\nis usually assumable and would be unlikely to include a prepayment penalty.\nThe major advantage of an ARM for the borrower is greater affordability because\nthe interest rate at the inception and perhaps for the \ufb01rst few years of the loan is gener-\nally lower than the rate for \ufb01xed rate mortgages.\nGraduated Payment Mortgage\nThe graduated payment mortgage (GPM) begins with low payments but increases at\nregular intervals for a set number of years and then levels out for the balance of the term.\nThis way, the buyer can qualify for a higher loan than he could on a normal installment\nfully amortizing loan. For example, payments could increase by 2 1/2 percent a year for\n5 years and then remain constant for the balance of the 30-year loan term.\nThe loan payments in the early years of a GPM can result in negative amortization.\nNegative amortization occurs when the monthly loan payment is not enough to pay the\ninterest due. The excess is added to the balance owed, which creates an increasing loan\nbalance rather than an amortizing (decreasing) loan balance.\nReverse Annuity Mortgage\nUnder all reverse annuity mortgage (RAM) programs, the house is appraised and a\nloan is made based on a certain percentage of the current value. The loan is paid to\nthe homeowner in the form of a monthly annuity, which provides monthly payments\nto the owner for the rest of his or her life or the life of the loan. During the loan period,\nthe homeowner owns and lives in the house.\n303\n",

The loan is an ARM, and the rates are adjusted either annually or monthly,\nw i t h c a p s o n increases.\nRAMs have gained in popularity as the country's population has grown older. The\nRAM is designed to enable retired homeowners to use the equity in their homes as a\nsource of additional income, while still retaining ownership.\nShared Appreciation Mortgage\nIn a shared appreciation mortgage (SAM), the lender participates in the appreciation\nof the property value and in turn accepts a note with a lower rate of interest. For the right\nto share in a portion of the appreciation, the lender will make the loan at an interest rate\nthat is lower than the market rate of interest for a \ufb01xed-term conventional loan. The ap-\npreciation of the property is determined at the time the property is sold by comparing the\nsales price of the property to the original cost.\nParticipation Loan\nA participation loan is one where the lender participates in the pro\ufb01ts generated by a\ncommercial property used to secure the debt. The borrower agrees to the lender's par-\nticipation in the revenues or net income of the property as an incentive for the lender\nto make the loan.\nRESIDENTIAL LENDING\nThere are two major categories of residential loans: conventional loans and government-\nbacked loans. Government-backed loans include FHA loans and VA loans. An FHA\nloan is one that is insured by the FHA. A VA loan is one that is partially guaranteed\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). A conventional loan is any loan that is\nnot a government-backed loan.\nConforming vs. Nonconforming\nThe U.S. Congress sets maximum limits on conventional loans purchased by Freddie\nMac and Fannie Mae. Currently (2007), this limit is $417,000. Loans for this amount\nand less that meet Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae underwriting criteria are easily bro-\nkered through the secondary mortgage market. These conventional loans are known\nas conforming loans.\nNonconforming loans, also known as jumbo loans or high balance loans, can also\nbe sold to the secondary mortgage market, although the purchaser will most likely be a\nnongovernment entity. Private corporations, usually subsidiaries of large \ufb01nancial insti-\ntutions, have been formed to purchase these jumbo loans by issuing mortgage-backed\nsecurities collateralized by the loans. These private corporations operate in much the\nsame manner as Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, or Fannie Mae. Because of the higher risk\nand smaller pool of funds available for the purchase of these loans, nonconforming\nloans generally bear a higher interest cost\nConforming Loan Guidelines\nIn today's market, conforming loans will generally follow the guidelines established by\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae because the vast majority of conventional loans are sold to\nthe secondary mortgage market. Govemment-backed loans will undoubtedly follow the\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\nunderwriting guidelines of the FHA or DVA. Even though a loan originator does not\nplan to sell loans in the secondary market, the underwriting guidelines provide a uniform\nset of criteria for the properties and borrowers' quali\ufb01cations.\nMaximum Mortgage Limits\nMaximum mortgage limits for conforming loans are established by geographic area and\nare periodically revised. A mortgage broker or banker can advise you on the current con-\nforming loan limits in a particular area. In 2007, in Arizona, the Freddie Mac and Fannie\nMae loan limits ranged from $417,000 for single-family original loan amounts on a one-\nunit dwelling to $801,950 for a four-unit dwelling. FHA limits vary by county in\nArizona and are based on a percentage of the Freddie Mac loan limits. For instance,\nin August 2007, the FHA loan limit for a one-family unit in Flagstaff (Coconino County)\nwas $342,000, but in Tucson (Pima County) it was $239,850. Maximum DVA entitle-\nments are available in amounts up to 25 percent of the maximum Freddie Mac loan limit,\nor, for 2007, S104,250 for one-unit to $200,488 for a four-unit dwelling.\nUnderwriting Guidelines\nUnderwriting guidelines should always consider certain areas of review, regardless of\nwhether they are promulgated by Fannie Mae or just the lender. These areas are called\nthe four C's of lending: credit, capacity, character, and collateral.\nA review of these areas should answer these questions:\nCredit: Has the applicant used credit responsibly in the past? Does the applicant\nhave an acceptable credit history?\nCapacity: Does the applicant have suf\ufb01cient \ufb01nancial resources to repay his or her\nexisting debts and the proposed additional debt?\nCharacter: Traditionally described as an applicant's \"desire\" or \"willingness\" to\nrepay the debt. Character is more dif\ufb01cult to measure because it is a subjective\nevaluation.\nCollateral: Is adequate property being used as security for the loan?\n305\nLoan-to-Value Ratio\nThe loan-to-value ratio (LTV) quanti\ufb01es the collateral risk the lender takes and, con-\nversely, the equity the borrower risks losing. It is often considered the most important\nunderwriting ratio. It is calculated, simply:\nMortgage amount\n= LT V\nLesser of sales price or appraised value\nThe important thing to understand about LTV is that the higher the LTV, the less\nequity is at stake for the borrower. This has a signi\ufb01cant impact on the borrower's re-\npayment attitude if his \ufb01nancial circumstances change for the worse.\nDuring the 1980s, lenders involved in the secondary market developed two addi-\ntional LTV ratios that acknowledged the complex changes taking place in the industry.\nCombined loan-to-value (CLTV) for Fannie Mae and total loan-to-value (TLTV) for\nFreddie Mac take into consideration any secured lien junior to the proposed mortgage.\nThis ratio compares the total amount of all mortgages and/or home equity \ufb01nancing, re-\ngardless of the source, to the lesser of the sales price or appraised value. The second ratio\napplies only to special situations where a potential borrower has previously arranged a\n",

In these situations, the home equity line\nof credit must be included in the calculation of CLTV or TLTV, but several differing con-\nditions can be applied that will increase the limits for CLTV or TLTV for borrowers with\ngood credit scores, resulting in a ratio called the home equity LTV (HCLTV) for Fannie\nMae and home equity LTV (HTLTV) for Freddie Mac.\nLenders are able to make many more loan programs available to borrowers with much\ngreater \ufb02exibility because of these expanded ratios that are now acceptable to Fannie Mac\nand Freddie Mac\nAcceptable Properties\nAs de\ufb01ned by Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac, acceptable properties to be used as collateral for\nthese loans are determined by type of property ownership for conventional loan eligibility:\nPrincipal residence: A one- to four-family property that is the primary residence of\nat least one of the borrowers. The borrower must occupy the property, take title to\nthe property, and execute the note and deed of trust. The maximum LTV is usually\n95 percent.\nSecond home: A single-family property that the borrower occupies in addition to his\nor her principal residence. (Note: A two- to four-family property is not an eligible\nproperty for second-home status.) When the property is classi\ufb01ed as a second home,\nrental income may not be used to qualify the borrower. Maximum LTV is usually 80\nto 90 percent.\nInvestment property: A one- to four-family property that the borrower does not oc-\ncupy. This de\ufb01nition is used whether or not the property produces income. The\nmaximum LTV is usually 70 to 80 percent.\nPrivate Mortgage Insurance\nSince the advent of lending at LTVs ratios exceeding 80 percent, particularly by \ufb01nan-\ncial institutions, the mortgage insurance business has thrived. Today, nearly all lenders\nwho grant conventional loan requests in excess of an 80 percent total LTV will require\nsome type of private mortgage insurance (PMI). FHA requires mortgage insurance on\nall of its loans and is more restrictive, because of its lower loan limits, than PMI. FHA\nvolume is less volatile than PMI volume. Thus, in the 1990s, PMI increased dramati-\ncally, and by 2000, PMI accounted for 62 percent of the morgage insurance market.\nMortgage insurance insures the part of the purchase price or re\ufb01nance that is not\ncovered by the down payment (if there is one) and an 80 percent loan. P M companies\nhave many different and varied products available. Regardless, a premium is calcu-\nlated and charged to the borrower, usually as an addition to the monthly mortgage\npayment. The borrower can usually cancel mortgage insurance when her equity\nreaches 20 percent. Additionally, a federal law, the Homeowners' Protection Act of\n1997, mandates that lenders automatically cancel PMI when the borrower's mortgage\nbalance reaches 78 percent of the original purchase price.\nMaximum Allowable Contributions\nUnder Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines for conforming loans, maximum allow-\nable borrower contributions depend on the LTV and the occupancy type. Any costs nor-\nmaly paid by the borrower are included as alowable contributions, even if paid by the\nseller. These costs could include an origination fee, discount points, credit report, ap-\npraisal fees, one-half escrow, ALTA premiums, recording fees, prepaid interest, taxes,\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\n307\ninsurance, and the like. The seller can pay part or all of the borrower's contributions, as\nlong as the total doesn't exceed the maximum allowable as follows:\nLoan-to-Value Ratio\nOccupancy Type\nMaximum Percentage\nof Borrower's Contri-\nbutions That Can Be\nPaid by Seller\nGreater than 90%\nPrincipal residence\n3 % of the lesser of the\nsales price o r appraised\nvalue\n90% o r less\nPrincipal residence\n6% of the lesser o f the\nsales price o r appraised\nv a l u e\n80% or less (or the\ncombined LTV is 90%\nor less)\nSecond home\n6% of the lesser of the\nsales price o r appraised\nv a l u e\nAny LTV is \ufb01ne, as long\nas the loan is \ufb01xed rate\n+ Investment property\n2% of the lesser of the\nsales price or appraised\nv a l u e\nOther Costs\nThe buyer or seller may also pay other costs. These other costs could include a one-time\nup-front mortgage insurance premium or the \ufb01rst year's premium for a renewable mort-\ngage insurance policy. However, any costs that are normally the responsibility of the\npurchaser are considered contributions if the seller pays them. Therefore, an adjustment\nmay be required to the property's sales price or appraised value (whichever is less).\nFHA Loans\nThe FHA is part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nFHA does not make loans; it insures loans made by approved lenders and sets minimum\nrequirements for properties and borrowers.\nFHA loans are available to any legal resident of the United States whose income is\nsuf\ufb01cient to make the mortgage payment, who has an acceptable credit history, and who\nhas suf\ufb01cient funds to close the transaction.\nFHA Guidelines\nFHA has many different insurance programs that are generally based on the type of\nproperty and loan being sought. By far the most popular and most familiar to the public\nis Section 203(b). Some parameters for FHA loans follow:\n\u2022 FHA loans are available to anyone who is \ufb01nancially quali\ufb01ed.\n\u2022 The buyer's credit history may have some blemishes.\n\u2022 Eligible properties can be from one to four units, and must be owner-occupied.\n\u2022 Although this does not have to come entirely from the buyer, a 3 percent minimum\ncash investment is required.\n\u2022 Generally, FHA permits a borrower to carry more debt in total than most conventional\nlenders.\n",

The maximum dollar amount allowed\nincreases when housing costs for an area support higher limits. In Arizona, these limits\nare set by county. In some instances, certain speci\ufb01c areas within a particular county\nmay be designated as \"high cost areas.\" As of August 2007, the limits for single-family\nresidences in Coconino, Maricopa, and Pima counties were 5332,500, S263,150, and\n$239,850, respectively.\nLoan-to-value limits require that the amount of any insured mortgage not ex-\nceed 97.65 percent of the appraised value of the property (or 98.75 percent, if the\nvalue is SS0,000 or less). The allowable mortgage is computed by applying the\nappraised value or sales price, whichever is less, times the appropriate percentage\nf r o m   t h i s   l i s t\n\u2022 Owner-occupied principal residences / values more than S125,000 = 97.15 percent\nof the sales price.\n\u2022 Owner-occupied principal residences / values more than $50,000 but less than\n$125,000 = 97.65 percent of the sales price.\n\u2022 Owner-occupied principal residences / values less than $50,000 = 98.75 percent of\nthe sales pnice.\nInterest rate and discount points charged to borrowers are not regulated by the FHA, but\nonce a borrower is approved, he must be reapproved if the interest rate is increased by\nmore than 1 percent or if the amount of discount points increases.\nFHA does not set a maximum interest rate for FHA loans. The loan can be a t\nany interest rate agreed upon between the buyer and seller, subject to lender availability.\nIf a borrower wishes to \"buy-down the interest rate on the loan by paying the\nlender points upfront, then the cost of the buy-down plus any origination points\npaid by the seller cannot exceed 6 percent of the loan amount, or the loan amount\nwill be decreased by the amount that exceeds 6 percent, resulting in a higher down\npayment.\nFHA-insured loans have no prepayment penalty. Most lenders require 30 days' no-\ntice of a morgagor's intention to pay off a loan. FHA loans are assumable only after\nquali\ufb01cation of the new borrower.\nFor insuring the loan, FHA charges the borrower a mortgage insurance premium\n(MIP). Part of the MIP, which is currently 1.5 percent of the loan amount, is paid\nupfront when the loan transaction closes. When the seller pays the upfront premium,\nit must be paid in cash. The borrower may pay the upfront premium in cash at closing,\nor the premium may be \ufb01nanced by adding it to the loan amount. The other part of the\nMIP is a monthly charge for an annual premium, currently 0.5 percent of the loan\namount. Premiums on mortgage loans with terms of I5 years or less may be signi\ufb01cantly\nlower depending on the size of the down payment. The annual MIPs are cancelled\nautomatically after 60 months or when the principal balance reaches 78 percent of the\nlower of a current appraised value or the initial sales price. If the loan is paid in full with-\nin the \ufb01rst 60 months, there may be a refund of the upfront mortgage insurance pre-\nmium. The borrower must apply to receive a refund.\nThe only acceptable properties for FHA-insured loans are owner-occupied one- to\nfour-family units.\nVeterans Administration Loans\nThe Veterans Administration (VA) was created in 1930 as an independent agency of the\nfederal government.\nIn 1944, Congress passed the GI Bill of Rights (or Serviceman's Readjustment\nAct). Its purpose was to help returning veterans adjust to civilian life by creating\nVA bene\ufb01t programs to encourage lenders to offer eligible veterans long-term, low\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\n3 0 9\ndown payment mortgages at reasonable interest rates. To accomplish this, the VA\nagreed to guarantee the loans and protect the lender from loss in the event of\nforeclosure.\nThe VA, which was absorbed by the DVA when it became a Cabinet post in 1989,\ndoes not loan money; it guarantees a portion of the loans made to veterans by lenders\nunder the VA programs. Even though the VA is now known as the DVA, the loans them-\nselves are still commonly referred to as VA loans.\nVA Loan De\ufb01ned\nA VA loan is a real estate mortgage available to quali\ufb01ed veterans for the purpose of\nbuying or re\ufb01nancing real estate for personal residential use only. A veteran must\nown and occupy the property being mortgaged with VA \ufb01nancing. A veteran may pur-\nchase a two- to four-family dwelling but must occupy one of the units as his or her pri-\nmary residence. A veteran's spouse can meet the owner occupancy requirement.\nThe advantages of VA \ufb01nancing include the following:\n\u2022 N o down payment.\n\u2022 Interest rates negotiable between borrower and lender.\n\u2022 Liberal qualifying guidelines.\n\u2022 Assumable by quali\ufb01ed purchaser with no change in interest rate.\n\u2022 No prepayment penalty.\n\u2022 Use of partial eligibility.\n\u2022 Re\ufb01nance eligible.\n\u2022 Seller can pay 100 percent of closing costs and the seller can pay up to 4 percent\nof purchase price toward prepaids.\nMaximum Loan Amount a n d Maximum Term\nThe Veterans Bene\ufb01t Improvement Act of 2004, among other changes, increased the\nmaximum VA loan guaranty amount on loans over $144,000 by indexing the\nmaximum guaranty amount to 25 percent of the conventional conforming loan\nlimit established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As of January 1, 2007, this\nloan limit was set at $417,000, resulting in a maximum guaranty entitlement of\n$104,250.\nFor VA loans, the maximum term is 30 years.\nInterest Rates and Discounts\nInterest rates are negotiated by the veteran with the lender. The DVA has guidelines for\nacceptable interest rates. If the negotiated interest rate is higher than the guideline, an\ninterest rate buy-down may be necessary.\nThe veteran or the seller can pay the discount points necessary to increase the yield\non the loan to the lender, However, the discount points cannot be \ufb01nanced in the loan\namount. This includes re\ufb01nances and \"rate reduction\" re\ufb01nances.\nEligible Properties\nQuali\ufb01ed veterans may use the funds from VA home loans for any of the following\npurposes:\n1.

When an appraisal\nis completed, a Certi\ufb01cate of Reasonable Value (CRV) is issued to the veteran. CRVs are\nvalid for 6 months (12 months on properties proposed for construction). The maximum\nloan amount and term of the loan for the particular property are determined by the\nappraised value set forth on the CRV.\nA veteran may pay more for a home than stated on the CRV if she signs a statement\nacknowledging that the price is more than shown on the CRV and that the difference is\nbeing paid by the veteran from her own, unfettered funds.\nDVA Funding Fee\nThe DVA charges a funding fee on all loans. The funding fee can range from 2 to\n3.35 percent.\nThe veteran or seller may pay the funding fee. If paid by the veteran, it may be\nadded to the loan amount and \ufb01nanced over the life of the mortgage. However, the max-\nimum loan amount, including funding fee, on a zero-down purchase transaction still may\nnot exceed $417,000.\nQualifying for a VA Loan\nThe DVA requires that a veteran qualify for a VA loan under two methods: the residual\nmethod or the ratio method.\nThe residual method determines how much money a veteran will have left after\npaying all expenses including taxes and insurance, maintenance, utilities, debts, state\nand federal income tax, Social Security, and so on. The amount of money needed\nvaries by geographical location, family size, and size of mortgage. The ratio method\ncalculates \"housing expense plus debi\" as a percentage of income with the stipula-\ntion that it should not exceed 41 percent. Very strong, compensating factors must be\nevident for a VA loan to be approved if the \"total obligations\" ratio exceeds\n41 percent.\nEntitlement\nEntitlement is the maximum amount the DVA will guarantee a lender in the event of\ndefault. It bears a relationship to \"maximum mortgage\" but is not the same thing.\nIf a veteran has never used his housing bene\ufb01ts, the veteran is automatically eli-\ngible for a mortgage equal to four times entitlement. Entitlement was increased to\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\n$36,000 for both re\ufb01nances and purchases as of March 1, 1988. It was increased to\n$50,750 for purchase transactions on December 20, 1999, but only when the purchase\nprice exceeds $144,000. In 2007, a veteran's basic entitlement was still $36,000, al-\nthough that amount could be increased up to $104,250 for certain loans in excess of\n$144,000. Lenders will generally loan up to four times a veteran's available entitle-\nment without a down payment, provided that the veteran has the income and credit\nhistory to qualify.\nIf a veteran previously used her bene\ufb01ts but sold the home and either paid off the\nloan in full or sold it on an assumption to another veteran who substituted his entitlement,\nthen the \ufb01rst veteran's entitlement would be restored to the current basic entitlement\namount.\nRequirements for Restoration of Entitlement\nDeed must transfer.\nLoan must be paid in full.\nThe mortgage company must notify the DVA that the loan has been paid in full be-\nfore entitlement can be restored.\nRequirements for Substitution of Entitlement\nWhen House Is Sold by Assumption\n1. Purchaser must be a veteran.\n2. Veteran purchaser must have as much loan guaranty entitlement available to use as\nwas used by the original veteran purchaser.\n3. Veteran purchaser must be willing to substitute his entitlement for the original veteran\npurchaser.\n4. Veteran purchaser must meet the underwriting requirements of the DVA. The DVA\ndoes the processing of the assumption.\nThe Certi\ufb01cate of Eligibility determines a veteran borrower's maximum entitlement. If\na veteran has previously used her entitlement and it has not been restored, a down pay-\nment may be required. Typically, veteran borrowers make no down payment.\n311\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nThe \ufb01nancing of real property typically involves the use of a promissory note, along\nwith some type of security instrument, such as a note and mortgage, a note and deed\nof trust, or a contract for deed. A promissory note is a promise by the maker of the\nnote to pay a speci\ufb01ed amount in accordance with speci\ufb01c terms by a certain date.\nThe maker of the note is the payor and the lender is called the payee. A note is personal\nproperty and as a negotiable instrument can be sold. A note must include the essentials\nof a contract. A note also contains the words promise to pay, the date of origin, and the\ndue date. A note must set forth the provisions for the repayment of the loan, must state\nthe interest rate, and must be signed by the maker or borrower. Because the note is a\nnegotiable instrument, the obligation to pay can be sold by the holder of the note without\npermission of the payor. When a note is sold to a third party, the purchaser of the note is\nknown as a holder in due course. The purchaser has all the rights of the original holder. It\nis also possible to have a co-signer on a note. Al signers are individually and collec-\ntively responsible for the repayment of the note. This is known as joint and several\nliability.\n",

Whether it was created intentionally or acci-\ndentally, a mortgage can only be foreclosed judicially by \ufb01ling a lawsuit. Deeds of trust\nare an exception to the general rule of law and can be created if the parties follow all the\nstatutory requirements. A contract for sale or agreement for sale is also an exception to\nthe general rule and is created when the obligation being secured is the purchase price of\nthe property, and the seller is the payce. In a contract for sale, the seller retains legal title\nto the property until the buyer has paid the full amount due. Until that time, the buyer\nholds only equitable title.\nThe security instrument used in a real estate transaction, whether a mortgage or deed\nof trust, will contain certain clauses that identify the terms and conditions of appropriate\nrepayment and/or default and foreclosure action. Provisions that may be included in a\nmortgage include a maintenance clause, prepayment clause, alienation clause, accelera-\ntion clause, defeasance clause, and subordination clause. These clauses are described in\ndetail in the body of the text.\nThere are many different types of mortgages described in the body of the text. This\nsummary will not include descriptions of all these mortgages. An open-end mortgage\nenables a borrower to have a preapproved loan available for future money requirements.\nAn adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) results in a sharing of risks of a \ufb02uctuating interest\nrate economy between the borrower and lender. An ARM allows the lender to make in-\nterest rate adjustments by referring to a national index. A graduated payment mortgage\n(GPM) begins with low payments but increases at regular intervals for a set number of\nyears and then levels out for the balance of the term. A participation loan is one where\nthe lender participates in the pro\ufb01ts generated by a commercial property used to secure\nthe debt. The borrower agrees to the lender's participation in the revenues or net income\nof the property as an incentive for the lender to make the loan.\nTrust deeds have been used in Arizona as the principal instrument to secure real\nproperty since 1971. Lenders prefer trust deeds because it takes a shorter time to fore-\nclose. As in any trust arrangement, there are three parties involved: the trustor, the trustee,\nand the bene\ufb01ciary. The trustor is the borrower, or the mortgagor in a mortgage. The\ntrustor gives bare legal title to the trustee. The trustee holds bare legal title to the property.\nHe or she has the power of sale if the borrower defaults. The bene\ufb01ciary is the lender or\nmortgage and will receive bene\ufb01ts from the action of the trustee or trustor.\nThe execution of a trust deed involves the following steps: The trustor conveys lim-\nited legal title to the trustee. The trustor makes payments to the bene\ufb01ciary according to\nthe note. When the \ufb01nal payment is made, the bene\ufb01ciary noti\ufb01es the trustee that the\nloan has been paid off. Then, the trustee reconveys the naked title to the trustor by deliv-\nering a deed of reconveyance to the trustor. If the trustor defaults, the bene\ufb01ciary\ninstructs the trustee to foreclose according to the laws that govern trust deed foreclosure.\nThe primary difference between a trust deed and a mortgage is the time and process\ninvolved in foreclosure.\nA contract for deed enables the seller to \ufb01nance a buyer by permitting the buyer to\nmake a down payment followed by monthly payments. A contract for deed does not have\nan accompanying promissory note; it is a single, complete \ufb01nancing and installment sales\nagreement between a buyer and seller. The parties to a contract for deed are known as the\nvendor (seller) and vendee (buyer). The most signi\ufb01cant feature of this type of transaction\nis that the vendor does not deliver a deed to the vendee at the closing. Rather, the vendor\npromises to deliver the deed in the future when the buyer has satis\ufb01ed the terms of the\ncontract. During the period, the buyer has equitable title to the property.\nThere are two major categories of residential loans: conventional loans and\ngovernment-backed loans, which are FHA loans and VA loans. An HA loan is one\nthat is insured by the Federal Housing Administration. A VA loan is one that is partially\nguaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. A conventional loan is any loan that\nis not a government-backed loan.\nChapter 21 \u2022 Real Estate Financing Instruments\nNonconforming loans can also be sold to the secondary mortgage market al-\nthough the purchaser will most likely be a nongovernment entity. Conforming loans\nwill generally follow the guidelines established by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae be-\ncause the vast majority of conventional loans are sold to the secondary mortgage mar-\nket. Government-backed loans follow the underwriting guidelines of the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) or Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). Maximum\nmortgage limits for conforming loans are established by geographic area and are pe-\nriodically revised.\nUnderwriting guidelines should always consider certain areas of review, regard-\nless of whether they are promulgated by Fannie Mae or just the lender. Known as\nthe C's of lending, the areas to review are: credit, capacity, collateral, and character.\nThe loan-to-value ratio (LTV) quanti\ufb01es the collateral risk the lender takes and, con-\nversely, the equity the borrower risks losing. It is often considered the most important\nunderwriting ratio. The higher the LTV, the less equity is at stake for the borrower.\nNearly all lenders who grant conventional loan requests in excess of an 80 percent\ntotal LTV will require some type of private mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance\ninsures the part of the purchase price or re\ufb01nance that is not covered by the down pay-\nment (if there is one) and an 80 percent loan. Under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nguidelines for conforming loans, maximum allowable borrower contributions depend\non the LTV and the occupancy type.\nThe FHA is part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(HUD). FHA does not make loans; it insures loans made by approved lenders and\nsets minimum requirements for properties and borrowers. FHA loans are available\nto any legal resident of the United States whose income is suf\ufb01cient to make the mort-\ngage payment, who has an acceptable credit history, and who has suf\ufb01cient funds to\nclose the transaction. The guidelines for FHA loans are described fully in the body\nof the text.\nThe DVA does not loan money; it guarantees a portion of the loans made to vet-\nerans by lenders under the VA programs. Even though the VA is now known as the\nDVA, the loans themselves are still commonly referred to as \"VA loans.\" A VA\nloan is a real estate mortgage available to quali\ufb01ed veterans for the purpose of buying\nor re\ufb01nancing real estate for personal residential use only. A veteran must own and\noccupy the property being mortgaged with VA \ufb01nancing. A veteran may purchase a\ntwo- to four-family dwelling but must occupy one of the units as his or her primary\nresidence. A veteran's spouse can meet the owner occupancy requirement.\n313\nacceleration clause\nadjustable rate mortgage (ARM)\ncharacter\nalienation clause\ncollateral\nall-inclusive deed of trust\nconforming loan\nbare legal title\nconstruction loan\nbene\ufb01ciary\ncontract for deed\nblanket mortgage\ncontract for sale\nconventional loan\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\ncapacity\nCerti\ufb01cate of Eligibility\n",

If a loan is not repaid appropriately.\nthen the lender can just take the property back and resell it or hold on to it as an invest-\nment. The answer is simply that lenders are in the money business, not the real estate\nbusiness. Probably the last thing a lender wants is to take back a property. Going through\nthe foreclosure and redemption process is expensive and time-consuming. In most cases,\nthe lender will lose money through the cost of time and resources devoted to the fore-\nclosure process.\nMany years ago, when 50 percent down payments were common, qualifying the\nborrower was not as important as it is today. With a large down payment, the borrower\nhas more equity and is less likely to default. In today's market, lenders are making high\nloan-to-value ratio conventional and goverment-backed loans that require little, if any,\ndown payment. With no equity in the property, borrowers have little incentive to make\n",

A real estate market in a down\ncycle can actually produce real estate values that are less than the remaining loan\nbalances.\nBecause most loans are sold to the secondary market, there must be standards of\nqualifying that will demonstrate the borrower's willingness and capacity to pay. Lenders\ngenerally evaluate these areas through the use of qualifying guidelines called ratios.\nTwo ratios most often used are monthly mortgage payments to income ratio, called\nthe income ratio, and obligations to income ratio, generally referred to as the back-\nend ratio. These ratios are used to determine a borrower's capacity or ability to pay.\nIn general, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require an income ratio of 28 percent or\nless and a back-end ratio of 36 percent or less. FHA uses the same qualifying procedure\nas conventional lenders except that they will accept higher ratios (29 percent and\n41 percent), but the ratios must include the cost of mortgage insurance. The Department\nof Veterans Affairs (DVA) uses a more complicated two-phase qualifying procedure:\n(1) the residual income method, and (2) application of qualifying income ratio. Residual\nincome is the amount of gross income left after deducting income and Social Security\ntaxes and/or retirement plan contributions to arrive at net take-home pay, then deducting\nhousing expenses and \ufb01xed obligations (long-term debt, alimony, child support, and so\non). Under DVA guidelines, the qualifying income ratio is determined by taking the\nmonthly housing expenses (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) plus long-term\ndebts and dividing this total by net take-home pay. If the ratio is 41 percent or less,\nthe borrower will qualify. If the ratio is above 41 percent, then the underwriter must\nlook at other compensating factors.\nBorrower's Income\nIn determining a borrower's qualifying income, what do lenders include? Obviously, a\nborrower's camed income is the primary basis for determining income levels in qualify-\ning a borrower. The income may be in the form of salaries and wages, commissions,\nbonuses, self-employment income, rents, alimony, child support payments, Social Secu-\nrity, and pension distributions. Wages from part-time employment are also included if\nthere is a consistent patter. Overtime earnings may also be considered if borrowers\ncan demonstrate the overtime's consistency and dependability. Income claimed in the\nborrower's loan application will be subject to veri\ufb01cation by the lender, so the borrower\nshould be prepared to provide copies of all important documents (W-2 forms, 1099s, in-\ncome tax retums, and so on) in addition to signing veri\ufb01cation of employment and ver-\ni\ufb01cation of deposit forms.\nBorrower's Expenses\nA borrower's expenses can be separated into two categories: housing expenses and\nmonthly expenses. The table below shows examples of each type of expense.\nFor conventional loans, lenders may use IRS forms or copies of income tax returns\nto determine amounts of Social Security and income taxes withheld. FHA and DVA\nHousing Expenses\nPrincipal and interest payment\nTaxes and insurance\nMortgage insurance\nAssociation dues, if there is a\nhomeowners' association\nMaintenance a n d utilities\nMonthly Expenses\nSocial Security\nState and local taxes\nLong-term debts\nChild support and/or alimony\nChapter 22 \u2022 Qualitying Borrowers; Interest and Discount Points\n3 1 9\npublish charts for use by lenders in calculating taxes, insurance, maintenance, and\nutilities.\nDebts\nDebts are treated differently depending on the type of loan. According to the guidelines,\ndebts are considered \"long-term\" if their repayment period will be longer than the\nfollowing:\nDVA-All debts that require more than 6 months are considered long-term.\nConventional-All debts that require more than 10 months are considered long-\nt e r m .\nFHA-All debts that require more than 12 months are considered long-term.\nGenerally speaking, most other debt is not counted in the qualifying ratios because it can\nbe repaid in a short period of time. However, credit card balances that are beyond the\nborrower's ability to repay within the above time frames will be counted in the calcula-\ntion of long-term debt.\nA salesperson should have a clear understanding of the qualifying guidelines and the\nqualifying process. The \ufb01nal decision, however, is up to the underwriter at the lender's\nof\ufb01ce. A loan of\ufb01cer is better quali\ufb01ed to advise a buyer if a payment or adjustment\nneeds to be made in the qualifying package.\nMeeting with the Lender\nDuring an interview with the lender, a borrower will be asked to provide loan numbers,\nloan balances, income tax returns, and money to pay for credit reports and an appraisal.\nThe borrower also will be asked to sign VOEs, or veri\ufb01cations of employment, and\nVODs, veri\ufb01cations of deposit, which are sent by the lender to the borrower's employ-\ner(s) and bank(s) for veri\ufb01cation of the information supplied by the borrower. In today's\nreal estate market, mortgage lenders do a great deal of marketing and advertising aimed\nat potential borrowers. Therefore, many of today's buyers enter the real estate market\nwith a loan quali\ufb01cation already in hand. Much of this marketing is done via the Inter-\nnet, which results in signi\ufb01cant savings in time and resources for all of the parties\ninvolved. A potential buyer may have already supplied the mortgage lender with the\nnecessary income and expense documentation and credit reports, leaving only the qual-\ni\ufb01cation of the subject property to be accomplished.\nThe type and source of income are important, but the lender will also be concerned\nwith the stability of the income. Factors to be considered will include employment and\nincome history, job changes, type of job, and age of the borrower. A consistent employ-\nment history of at least n o years is generally required although a recent change in em-\nployment is not considered negatively if it is a promotion or a better job. A self-\nemployed individual will usually be asked to provide copies of his or her tax returns\nas well. If a borrower is going to retire within a year or two, then the lender will\nwant to know what kind of retirement income the borrower will have and whether it\nwill be suf\ufb01cient to make the payments on the loan.\nUnderwriting the Loan\nThe overwhelming majority of residential real estate loans written today are intended for\nsale in the secondary market. As a result, most lenders follow the core underwriting\nguidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as published in their separate Seller/Servicer\nGuides, or of such govemment programs as FHA or DVA. These industry standards\n",

However, each loan represents a separate risk and that risk must be analyzed\nand reviewed on an individual basis. While the use of technology through improved\ndata management and statistical analysis has enabled the industry to process an unprec-\nedented number of loans, the traditional areas for review are still paramount to the loan\ndecision. These four areas are credit, capacity, character, and collateral.\nCredit Analysis\nCredit reporting agencies play a major role in the analysis and evaluation of a bor-\nrower's credit.

Lenders will obtain credit reports from all three credit-\nreporting agencies (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax) and use the credit reports to\nanalyze the applicant's ability and desire to pay. The credit agencies will also supply\nthe lender with a credit score or FICO score that attempts to objectively determine\nthe probability of repayment of the debt by the applicant.\nWhen the applicant has had a mortgage payment in the past, that payment history\nwill play a large part in the \ufb01nal analysis.\nBankruptcy\nA bankruptey in an applicant's history will not automatically disqualify the loan appli-\ncant. A bankruptcy that occurred 3 to 5 years ago would be evaluated based on the cir-\ncumstances surrounding the applicant at the time he or she originally \ufb01led for\nbankruptcy. Also, the credit history since the applicant emerged from bankruptcy\nwould be given consideration.\nCapacity\nCapacity is the ability to pay the debt or loan being contemplated. Capacity depends on\nthe borrower's income. The level and type of income will be thoroughly evaluated by\nthe loan underwriters. Generally, the underwriters will not be as concerned with the\napplicant's speci\ufb01c position, industry, or whether he or she is a salaried or hourly em-\nployee, but whether the applicant maintains the same level of income regardless of its\nsource.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, economic events changed the approach to evaluating\nearnings and employment history. Numerous changes in employment consistent with\nthe same career path are considered a positive characteristic. \"Job stability\" today is\nused to de\ufb01ne a consistent income level and employment in related lines of work, rather\nthan having the same job for years on end. However, employment changes without ad-\nvancement or signi\ufb01cant pay increases may still be indicative of future \ufb01nancial\ninstability.\nCharacter\nCharacter is also referred to as desire or willingness to pay. Lenders have different\nways of approaching this task; some may do it formally and some may do it informally.\nAlthough prior payment history and credit scores are helpful, review of this area is ba-\nsically subjective and must be considered in context with the other areas above.\nChapter 22 \u2022 Qualitying Borrowers; laterest and Discount Points\n321\nCollateral\nIn the \ufb01nal analysis, the lender must protect himself and his investors by securing the\nloan with the borrower's property. The property that will be collateral for the loan\nmust b e adequate to insure that the lender will be able to recover his investment in\nthe event of a default by the borrower. In order to evaluate the collateral, the lender\nwill obtain an appraisal, which is an opinion or estimate of market value, from a\nlicensed or certi\ufb01ed appraiser. Appraisals and the appraisal process are discussed in\nChapter 19.\nThe loan underwriters will use the appraisal to determine whether the subject prop-\nerty conforms to the lender's property standards, is in marketable condition, and is of\nsuf\ufb01cient value to support the loan request.\nINTEREST AND DISCOUNT POINTS\nInterest is the cost or money paid for the use of someone else's money. A lender looks at\ninterest as money earned (income) from an investment (a loan). The amount of interest a\nlender charges will depend on the demand for loans and competition among lenders, as\nwell as the risk assumed. The greater the investor's (lender's) risk, the higher the interest\nrate will be. Risk, of course, involves not only the size of the loan but the quality of the\ncollateral or security and the borrower's credit history.\nMost real estate loans are based on simple interest, which is rent paid only for the\namount of the debt still outstanding. The formula to calculate simple interest 15:\nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time\nInterest is normally paid in arrears because it accrues or is eared through the pas-\nsage of time. Borrowers pay for the period of time they have used the money.\nExample: Based on the simple interest formula, the interest for a $1,500 loan at\n9 percent interest for 1 year is S135.\nP x R x T =1\n$1, 500 x 09 \u00d7 1 = S135\nTo \ufb01nd the monthly interest, divide by 12 (S135 \u00f7 12), which results in $11.25 for the\n\ufb01rst month's interest.\nLegal Rate and Usury\nIf the rate was left off of an obligation or omitted from a judgment, Arizona law provides\nfor a legal rate of 10 percent interest.\nUsury is charging interest at a higher rate than allowed by law. Arizona eliminated a\nusury limit on real property in 1979, and in 1980, President Carter declared a morato-\nrium on usury laws.\nDiscount Points\nLoans are made to yield a pro\ufb01t to the lender and provide a source of funds to the\nborrower. As discussed previously, the borrower's cost of using the funds is called\ninterest. The amount of return a lender receives on his loan is called yield. Yield is\ncalculated by dividing the annual interest income by the amount invested in the\nloan. A point is I percent of the loan amount. A discount is a charge made by lenders\nto increase the effective rate of interest (yield) from the stated interest rate on the note.\n",

By actually funding less than the loan\namount, the lender increases her yield over the loan's stated interest rate. A borrower\ncan choose from a wide variety of loan programs that offer varying interest rates and\ndiscount points.\nExample: If a borrower pays 3 points for a 30-year loan of $250,000 at a stated in-\nterest rate of 6 percent, the actual yield to the lender is 6.287 percent. Because the\nstated interest rate does not change, the lender would fund only $242,500, keeping\nthe difference and increasing his yield.\nAs a rule of thumb:\n\u2022 One discount point is equal to raising the yield on a 30-year loan by 1/8 of a\npercent.\nOr,\n\u2022 Eight points equals a 1-percent change in yield.\nInterest Rate Buy-Downs\nInterest rate buy-downs are slightly different from discount points. In this case, the\nstated interest rate is actually reduced prior to origination. The same process occurs,\nbut the borrower signs a note at a lower interest rate, and the lender funds the entire\namount of the original principal. There are several variations, some resulting in tempo-\nrary reductions in the mortgage payment for the borrower.\nExample: A home builder may have originally obtained a lender's commitment for\n\ufb01nancing the sale of the homes in her subdivision at 6.25 to 6.5 percent, but the\nmarket has changed. The builder may now agree to pay the 2 to 3 points to the lend-\ner to enable her to sell out her inventory at the current market rate of 6 percent.\nLOAN REPAYMENT PLANS\nInterest-Only Loans\nLoans that require periodic payment of the interest only are referred to as straight loans,\nbullet loans, term loans, and interest-only loans. The annual interest is calculated and\ndivided into the agreed upon number of payments (12, 4, 2, and so on). The \ufb01nal pay-\nment is called a balloon payment, which combines the \ufb01nal interest payment with the\ntotal principal amount due,\nExample: A seller carried-back a $10,000 loan at 8 1/2 percent interest only for\n5 years. The maturity date is the call date or stop. The monthly payment would be:\n$10, 000 x 085 = S850.00 \u00f7 12 = $70.83\nThe borrower would make 59 monthly payments of $70.83 and 1 of S10,070.83.\nBecause there was no principal reduction during the term of the loan, the monthly\ninterest never changed.\nAmortized Loans\nAn amortized loan is the most common type of real estate loan. This type of loan has an\ninstallment payment of principal and interest calculated for a certain period of time. The\nprincipal and interest payment remains constant throughout the life of the loan. The pay-\nment reduces the loan balance by varying amounts relative to the decreasing interest\nChapter 22 \u2022 Qualitying Borrowers; Interest and Discount Points\ncharge. In the beginning, the payment is primarily interest, while the principal portion\nincreases with each subsequent payment until the end of the life of the loan when the\npayment will be primarily principal. Because they are repaid in installments, amortized\nloans are generally referred to as installment loans.\nBudget Loans\nIn Arizona, it is common to \ufb01nd that the installment payment is required to include a\nprorated amount for property taxes and insurance, which is held in trust by the lender\nfor the payment of the property taxes and insurance. The prorated amount is generally\none-twelfth of the estimated taxes and insurance. This type of payment is referred to as\nPITI (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance), and the loans requiring this type of pay-\nment are sometimes called budget loans because the borrower is forced to put away\nmoney in trust for the payment of the property taxes and insurance. This trust account\nmay be referred to as an impound account or reserve account.\nPartially Amortized Installment Loans\nA partially amortized loan is used to obtain a lower monthly payment by restricting the\nlength of the loan. The installment payment may be calculated based on a 20-year am-\nortization, but the note may actually be due in 5 years. This results in a lower monthly\npayment for 5 years with a balloon payment due at the end of the period. A balloon\npayment is a note's \ufb01nal installment payment, which is greater than the preceding pay-\nments and pays the note in full.\nExample: A S150,000 loan at 8.5 percent amortized for 20 years with a 7-year call\nwould require 83 payments of $1,292.58 and one of S124,127.95.\nThese partially amortized loans are used when lenders are not willing to loan money for\nlong periods of time.\nDirect Reduction Loans\nA direct reduction loan calls for a constant principal reduction plus the interest due on\nthe unpaid balance. If a borrower were required to make a $100 principal reduction plus\n9 percent interest payment on a $1,200 loan, he would pay as follows:\n1st\npayment: $1, 200 x .09 = $10812 = $9.00 = $109.00\n2nd\npayment: $1, 100 x .09 = $ 9912 = $8.25 = $108.25\n3rd payment : S1, 000 x .09 = S 9012 = $7.50 = $107.50\n...and so on until the loan is paid off. These types of loans are rarely used in real estate\nlending; they are more commonly used by banks in making short-term working capital\nloans.\n323\nFINANCING MATH\nWhen completing interest math problems, remember the computation formula I = P x\nR x T. The \"T\" formula can also help in solving \ufb01nancing math problems. The \"T\"\nformula follows, with components placed in the \"T\" to assist you in solving the subse-\nquent problems:\n",

The annual rate i s determined:\n$200 x 12 = $2,400 annually\n$2,400/$30, 000 = 08 or 8%\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nBecause most loans are sold to the secondary market, there must be standards of qual-\nifying that will demonstrate the borrower's willingness and capacity to pay. Lenders\ngenerally evaluate these areas through the use of qualifying guidelines called ratios.\nTwo ratios most often used are monthly mortgage payments to income ratio, called\nthe income ratio, and obligations to income ratio, generally referred to as the back-\nend ratio. These ratios are used to determine a borrower's capacity or ability to pay.\nSeveral criteria must be considered in qualifying a borrower for residential \ufb01nanc-\ning. A borrower's eared income is the primary basis for determining income levels in\nqualifying a borrower. A borrower's expenses can be separated into two categories:\nhousing expenses and monthly expenses. Second, debts are treated differently depending\non the type of loan. Debts are considered \"long-term\" if their repayment period will be\nlonger than the following: VA\u2014al debts that require more than 6 months; conven-\ntional- -all debts that require more than 10 months; FHA-all debts that require more\nthan 12 months. Next, the overwhelming majority of residential real estate loans written\ntoday are intended for sale in the secondary market. As a result, most lenders follow the\ncore underwriting guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or of such government\nprograms as FHA or DVA. Finally, the traditional areas for review are still paramount\nto the loan decision. These four areas are credit, capacity, character, and collateral.\nCredit reporting agencies play a major role in the analysis and evaluation of bor-\nrowers' credit. The credit agencies will supply the lender with a \"credit score\" or\n\"FICO score\" that atempts to objectively determine the probability of the applicant\nrepaying the debt. A bankruptcy in an applicant's history will not automatically disqual-\nify the loan applicant.\nInterest is the cost or money paid for the use of someone else's money. A lender\nlooks at interest as income from an investment. The greater the lender's risk, the higher\nthe interest rate will be. Most real estate loans are based on simple interest, which is rent\npaid only for the amount of the debt still outstanding. The formula to calculate simple\ninterest is I = P x R x T. Interest is normally paid in arrears. If the rate was left off of an\nobligation or omitted from a judgment, Arizona law provides for a legal rate of 10 per-\ncent interest. Usury is charging interest at a higher rate than allowed by law. Arizona no\nlonger has a usury limit on real property.\nThe amount of retum a lender receives on his loan is called yield. A point is l percent\nof the loan amount. A discount is a charge made by lenders to increase the yield from the\nstated interest rate on the note. The points paid for the discount are paid by the borrower\nat loan closing or can be deducted from the loan proceeds at funding. Interest rate buy-\ndowns are slightly different from discount points. In this case, the stated interest rate is\nactually reduced prior to origination. The same process occurs, but the borrower signs\na note at a lower interest rate, and the lender funds the entire amount of the original\nprincipal.\nLoans that require periodic payment of the interest only are referred to as straight\nloans, bullet loans, term loans, and interest-only loans. The annual interest is calculated\nand divided into the number of payments agreed upon. The \ufb01nal payment is called a\nballoon payment.\n",

In the case of a re\ufb01nance or sale, the doc-\nument will probably be delivered to the escrow company so that all documents can be\nrecorded in the proper sequence. When a loan is simply paid off, the document should be\nrecorded and/or delivered to the borrower by the loan servicing agent or reconveyance trustee.\nLoan Assumptions\nA loan assumption can be used to transfer the liability for an existing loan to a buyer. A\nreal estate loan can be assumed when a new borrower is approved by the lender and a\nformal assumption agreement is executed. In this manner, the original borrower (the\nseller) can be relieved of responsibility for the existing loan, provided that release of\nliability is given and the new borrower formally assumes the loan. However, a formal\nassumption can still result in liability for both parties.\nTo formally assume a loan, the new buyer and the seller need to apply to the lend-\ner, who may approve the new borrower and grant the assumption. The new borrower\nmust formally assume the loan and the original borrower must obtain a release o f\nliability. Novation is a formal assumption in which a new borrower is substituted\nfor the original maker of the note. Unless there is a complete novation, both parties\ncould still be liable under a formal assumption. Complete novation is very similar\nto a new loan except the original mortgage or deed of trust remains in place and the\ncurrent principal balance stays the same. The new borrower assumes all \ufb01nancial re-\nsponsibility and the original borrower is relieved of all responsibility.\nSubject To\nA property may be purchased \"subject to\" the existing loan(s) of record. In this case, the\nbuyer does not agree to assume primary liability for these debts. Instead, the seller con-\ntinues to be obligated to repay these loans, even though the buyer will be making pay-\nments directly to the lenders). The seller remains responsible for any de\ufb01ciency.\nRealistically, the buyer will continue to make the payments in order to retain the prop-\nerty. Because the loans are secured by the property, if the buyer fails to make the pay-\nments, the lender will proceed against the property through foreclosure. Thus, the\ndistinction between an \"assumption\" and \"subject to\" is important only when the fore-\nclosure results in a de\ufb01ciency. To obtain a de\ufb01ciency judgment, the lender would only\nproceed against the maker of the note (the seller) for any unrecovered costs.\nDEFAULTS\nA default is a breach of one or more of the terms and conditions that the borrower\nagreed to in the loan and security agreements. The agreements may contain acceleration\nclauses that enable a lender to declare the full amount of the unpaid balance due should a\ndefault occur. Because the property is offered as security for the loan, lenders have the\nright to claim the property and sell it to get their money back. Lenders typically do not\nwant the property, but in many cases, they have no choice but to take the property and\nsell it through a foreclosure action to recover their investment.\nTypes of Defaults\nThere are different types of defaults that can occur depending on the tenns of the instru-\nment used to secure the loan.\nDelinquencies\nDelinquencies are the most common fonn of default. Delinquencies are past due pay:\nments. Most loan agreements state that payments are due on or before a speci\ufb01ed\nChapter 23 \u2022 Loan Satisfaction, Assumptions, Defaults, and Foreclosure\ndate. If payment is not made on time, the loan is technically in default. Today's stand-\nardized loan documents typically alow for a grace period of 15 days, then assess a late\npayment charge on the sixteenth day. This late payment charge is usually a percentage of\nthe payment. Lenders who have originated loans backed by Ginnie Mae must make pay-\nment to Ginnie Mae on the second day of each month, whether they have received pay-\nment or not. Delinquencies that are not resolved within 60 days are a genuine concer\nfor the lender or investor, as this typically begins the foreclosure process.\nProperty Taxes\nProperty taxes take priority over other liens; therefore unpaid property taxes create a\ndefault, because the lender's security position is jeopardized\nMost lenders will structure impound accounts, and the taxes are prorated over a\n12-month payment plan. Tax bills are sent to the lender who pays the taxes. A lender\nwill not usually allow a borrower to pay taxes directly. At any rate, all loan agreements\ninclude a clause that speci\ufb01es the borrower's responsibility to pay property taxes.\nHazard Insurance\nFailing to keep an appropriate policy of hazard insurance in force is also considered a\ndefault. The lender's security must be protected against loss from \ufb01re or other perils;\ntherefore, provisions for the continued coverage of the properties are necessary. Lenders\nare named as co-insured along with the borrower. Lenders require only \ufb01re and extended\ncoverage. Homeowners generally get a homeowner's policy, which provides the cover-\nage required by the lender and gives the homeowner some personal liability coverage as\nwell. If a borrower lets her insurance policy lapse, the lender has a right to secure a pol-\nicy to protect the lender's interest and charge the borrower.\nPoor Property Maintenance\nBorrowers have responsibility to protect the security of the lender, which means main-\ntaining property in a reasonable manner. Defaults due to poor property maintenance can\napply to one's own residence, as well as any investment property. It is not easy to judge\nthe extent of the \"waste\" that would create a default. It is, however, a condition of the\nloan agreement and can be considered a default if it becomes critical.\nFORECLOSURE ALTERNATIVES\nTypically, lenders do not want to own the property. In most cases, by the time lenders com-\nplete the foreclosure process, repossess the property, clean up the property, market it, and\n\ufb01nally sell it, they will undoubtedly show a net loss after the sale. Therefore, most lenders\nwill work with borrowers whose loans are delinquent due t o situations beyond the\nborrower's control, such as loss of a job or a serious illness. Lenders would rather\nwork with borrowers to get payments back on schedule than have a frustrated owner aban-\ndon the property. Abandoned houses are often subjected to lack of maintenance, vandal-\nism, and uninvited guests. This situation leaves lenders with little to recoup their losses.\nForbearance\nObviously, most defaults are the result of delinquent payments. As the loan becomes a\nproblem loan, the lender may contact the borrower to see if it is necessary to restructure\npayments. An arrangement that effectively forestalls or delays foreclosure action is called\nforbearance. Partial payment or forbearance on the part of lenders comes from the days of\nthe Depression. Lenders may be urged by FHA and Fannie Mae to exercise forbearance\nduring periods of widespread unemployment and tight money. Sometimes loans are recast\n331\n",

Lenders may ask for more collateral or add co-\nsigners to a loan. However the payments and interest due may be restructured, the lender\nmust proceed with caution. If a lien that is junior to the lender's exists, then a modi\ufb01cation\nresulting in a more dif\ufb01cult situation for the borrower (such as a higher interest rate) can\nplace the subject note in a junior position. Additionally, the rules surrounding the statute of\nlimitations are somewhat complex but should de\ufb01nitely be taken into consideration when\nany forbearance or partial payment plan is being contemplated.\nD e e d i n Lieu\nA deed in lieu of foreclosure is used when an owner and lender wish to avoid the time-\nconsuming and expensive process of foreclosure. A deed in lieu of foreclosure is a mu-\ntual agreement in which the borrower is released from liability under the terms of the\nloan in exchange for a quitclaim deed or a regular grant deed. The deed in lieu is not\nas damaging to the borrower's credit history as a foreclosure. The deed in lieu may\nalso avoid the possibility of a de\ufb01ciency judgment. De\ufb01ciency judgments are discussed\nin more detail below. It should be noted, however, that new loan applications ask bor-\nrowers if they have ever executed a voluntary deed in lieu of foreclosure. Although this\ntechnique is expedient and ef\ufb01cient, it may not be used to avoid including the asset in a\nbankruptcy \ufb01ling. There needs to be some veri\ufb01cation that the borrower was solvent at\nthe time of the voluntary transfer.\nFORECLOSURE\nTo foreclose means to exclude from, deprive of the right, or shut out. Foreclosure is a\nprocedure that removes an owner's property rights. When real property is pledged as\nsecurity for a loan, the process of selling that property as a result of the borrower's\ndefault is called foreclosure. The borrower's property is sold to satisfy his debt.\nHistory of Foreclosure\nEarlier, we learned about landowners who borrowed money. When they did not make\nthe payment by \"law day,\" the property became the lender's property. \"Law day\" is\nancient terminology for the date that the payment is due and derives from the 1400s\nand English Common Law. This process was known as title theory. Faced with losing\ntheir land, the landowners appealed to the king, who tumed the problem over to the\nLord Chancellor, who was responsible for administering justice. Under certain circum-\nstances, the Lord Chancellor granted the landowners a period of time to come up with\nthe money and protect their property rights. This time was referred to as the equitable\nperiod of redemption. These days, the equitable period of redemption is the period\nof time from the \ufb01ling of the notice of default to the date of the sale.\nIf a debt was not paid during the equitable period of redemption, the Lord Chancel-\nlor and/or court of equity gave the lender the right to claim the forfeited collateral. This\nresulted in a decree of foreclosure, which became known as strict foreclosure. At the end\nof the equitable period of redemption, the lien holder was directed to sell the property,\npay off the debt, and hope that some of the equity could be saved for the landowner. In\naddition to these measures, there was also a period after the sale during which the land-\nowner could redeem the property, caled the statutory period of redemption. This pro-\ncess of foreclosure under old medieval laws is very similar to what we have today in\nmortgage foreclosure\nJudicial or Nonjudicial Foreclosure\nThe foreclosure process for a mortgage requires a judicial foreclosure. Under a judicial\nforeclosure, it is necessary to commence a lawsuit in state court, serve al interested\nChapter 23 \u2022 Loan Satisfaction, Assumptions, Defaults, and Foreclosure\nparties with summons and complaints, and wait for a hearing date before a judge. Be-\ncause it involves the court system, there may be numerous delays (particularly if the bor-\nrower contests the action), and then once a judgment is obtained, a sheriff's sale is\nscheduled. After the sheriff's sale, the debtor has 6 months (30 days if the property\nhas been abandoned) in which to redeem the property. The borrower may redeem the\nproperty after a foreclosure sale by paying the full amount due plus the costs and\nexpenses incurred by the lender to conduct the sale.\nIf the lender takes a deed of trust, the process is much simpler. It is much faster and\nless expensive to proceed by way of nonjudicial foreclosure or a trustee's sale. A notice\nof default is \ufb01led, and after 90 days, the trustee can sell the property at auction.\nIt is important to note that judicial foreclosure is not precluded because there is a\ndeed of trust. A lender may still use a judicial foreclosure even though she has a trust\ndeed and not a mortgage. Indeed, the lender may want to use judicial foreclosure for\none reason: The acceleration clause in the note is irrevocably invoked. When the com-\nplaint (lawsuit) is \ufb01led, the remaining principal balance, all unpaid installments, any\nunpaid property taxes, and all other costs and expenses become immediately due and\npayable. On the other hand, Arizona's trust deed statute allows the debtor under a\ndeed of trust the right to reinstate the loan at any time prior to the trustee's sale. To re-\ninstate the loan, the debtor only needs to bring the principal, interest, and property taxes\ncurrent, plus any costs and expenses that were incurred.\nProcess of Judicial Foreclosure\nThe steps for a judicial foreclosure are listed below. These actions must be initiated by\nthe lender or more likely by the lender's attomeys:\n1. File a notice of lis pendens (notice of legal action).\n2. File a foreclosure suit in superior court in the appropriate county requesting an\norder for the sheriff to sell the property.\n3. Invoke the acceleration clause in the note under the right of irrevocable acceleration.\n4. Notify all persons with an interest in the property of the court action and serve\nthem with a summons and complaint.\n5. After the court issues judgment, the lender must advertise the sale in the\nnewspaper once a week for 4 weeks.\n6. The court will issue a writ of execution and the county sheriff must then schedule\na sheriff's sale.\n7. The property is auctioned and sold to the highest bidder.\nDuring this process, from the date of \ufb01ling the complaint to the date of the sale, the\nowner can redeem the property by paying the entire loan amount plus interest due and\ncourt costs. This is the owner's equity of redemption period.\nOnce the property has been sold to the highest bidder, the borrower still has a period\nto redeem by law. In Arizona, this period lasts 6 months and is referred to as the stat-\nutory period of redemption. In order to redeem the property, the borrower must repay\nthe entire balance of the loan, plus costs and interest. The statutory redemption period\ncan be reduced to 30 days if the property has been abandoned.\nThe successful bidder at a judicial foreclosure receives a certi\ufb01cate of sale, which\nhe holds until after the statutory period of redemption. At that time, the bidder receives a\nsheriff's deed and may take possession of the property. If, however, the borrower con-\ntinues to occupy the subject property, the successful bidder and holder of the sheriff's\ndeed must evict the borrower. Eviction of the borrower is accomplished by \ufb01ling an\nexpedited court proceeding called a forcible detainer action. Eviction of the borrower\nwil take approximately 3 to 5 weeks.\n333\n",

This is done in the form of a de\ufb01ciency\njudgment. The name of this judgment refers to the fact that the sale of the security did\nnot generate enough money to satisfy the debt, leaving an unpaid balance.\nThe instruments that were used to create the lien were:\n1. A promissory note or promise to pay\n2. A mortgage or trust deed, which is a pledge of the real property as security for\nthe promissory note\nIf a lender intends to sue for de\ufb01ciency under the note, the lender may not bid at the sher-\niff's or trustee's sale. If the lender does not intend to sue for a de\ufb01ciency, the lender will\nmake the opening bid, which is usually the balance due plus interest and court costs. If\nthere is a junior lien holder, she must bid one dollar or higher than the opening bid to pro-\ntect her interest. If successful, the junior lien holder then assumes the responsibility of all\nsenior liens. Junior lien holders who do not bid into the auction will be \"wiped-out.\"\nAfter all debts and costs are paid, any leftover funds belong to the defaulted mort-\ngagor (the borrower).\nForeclosure under a Trust Deed\nThe holder of a deed of trust may use either a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure process.\nNonjudicial foreclosures are available when a trust deed has been used as the security\ninstrument. This is because of the naked or bare legal title transferred to the trustee by\nthe power of sale clause. When a borrower defaults, the bene\ufb01ciary (lender) noti\ufb01es the\ntrustee of the default and requests that the trustee foreclose using the power of sale\nclause. As discussed earlier, the time required to foreclose is considerably less than in\na judicial foreclosure.\nProcess of Nonjudicial Foreclosure\nThe steps for a nonjudicial foreclosure are listed below.\n1. Notice of default and intent to sell is \ufb01led. This gives notice of the intended sale. A\ndeed of trust cannot be accelerated unless judicially foreclosed as a mortgage. The\nintended sale cannot be scheduled for a period of at least 90 days beginning with the\ndate of \ufb01ling the notice of default.\n2. The trustee must include the time and place of the pending sale in the notice.\n3. The sale must be advertised in the newspaper once a week for 4 weeks.\n4. The trustee must send notice to all persons who have recorded an interest in the\nproperty by \ufb01ling a \"request for notice.\"\n5. The notice of the sale must be personally delivered or posted on the property\nprior to the sale.\n6. The sale cannot take place until at least the 91st day after the notice of default is \ufb01led.\n7. The property is auctioned and sold to the highest bidder, who immediately\nreceives title and possession.\nThere is no statutory period of redemption; therefore, the bidder receives a trustee\ndeed and possession with no waiting period, whereas the defaulted owner or borrower\nhas lost all property rights. As is the case with a judicial foreclosure, if the borrower\ncontinues to occupy the subject property, the successful bidder and holder of the\nChapter 23 \u2022 Loan Satisfaction, Assumptions, Defaults, and Foreclosure\ntrustee's deed must evict the borrower. Eviction of the borrower is accomplished by \ufb01l-\ning an expedited court proceeding called a forcible detainer action.\nThe 90-day period from the notice of default is known as the period of reinstatement.\nDuring this time, a borrower may reinstate the loan by making up all back payments\nplus costs and bringing the loan current, but he is not required to pay off the entire\nloan balance.\nThe Arizona Trust Deed Act does not allow for de\ufb01ciency judgments after a trustee\nsale of a residential single-family or duplex property of 2\u00bd acres or less. Except for a\npurchase money mortgage on a residential single-family or duplex property of 2\u00bd\nacres or less, a de\ufb01ciency judgment can be obtained if a lender proceeds with a judicial\nforeclosure, even though the lender holds a deed of trust as security.\nReal estate salespeople should be very careful when advising their clients on matters\nregarding the legal rami\ufb01cations of foreclosing on mortgages and trust deeds. A licensee\ncan be held liable for the consequences of any misinformation, as well as practicing law\nwithout a license.\nGovernment Loan Foreclosures\nFHA Foreclosures\nFHA foreclosures begin with the \ufb01ling of a notice of default. This notice of default must\nbe sent to the local FHA of\ufb01ce within 60 days of the default. In some cases, FHA coun-\nselors may attempt to negotiate a forbearance agreement between the mortgagor and the\nmortgagee. If the borrower's problems cannot be resolved, the mortgagee must \ufb01le a de-\nfault status report with FHA, then initiate foreclosure action. If necessary, the lender bids\non the property for the unpaid principal balance plus interest, costs, and expenses, then\ntakes title and presents FHA with an insurance claim. FHA may pay the claim in cash or\nin goverment bonds. In some cases, the lender assigns the defaulted mortgage to FHA\nbefore \ufb01nal foreclosure and FHA pays the insurance bene\ufb01ts. Although FHA may spend\nsome money to \ufb01x up these repossessed properties, in most cases FHA resells the prop-\nerty in an \"as is\" condition solely to help recoup its losses.\nDVA Foreclosures\nDVA foreclosures are handled differently. DVA loans are guaranteed by the govemment.\nWhen a VA loan goes into default, the lender must notify the local DVA of\ufb01ce within\n3 months. The DVA may, at its option, bring the loan current by advancing funds to the\nlender. This \"advance\" then takes priority over the lender's lien position because of the\nsubrogation rights granted to the DVA as a guarantor. The veteran pays an up-front fee\nfor this guarantee. However, if a de\ufb01ciency arises, the defaulted veteran is liable for any\nadvances or costs incurred by the DVA. The DVA will then attempt to work out an\narrangement with the veteran, which may include counseling, mediation, and\nforbearance.\nIn the case of a foreclosure sale, the lender is usually the original bidder at the auc-\ntion. Assuming the lender gets the property back, the lender will submit a claim to the\nlocal DVA of\ufb01ce for his or her losses. At this point, the DVA has the option to pay the\nclaim and take title to the property, or let the lender retain title to the property and pay\nonly the difference between the determined property value at the time of foreclosure and\nthe loan balance. When a property is seriously deteriorated, the DVA is more likely to\nchoose the latter option.\nPrivate Mortgage Insurance\nConventional loans that have private mortgage insurance (MIl) require the lender to no-\ntify the insuring company within 10 days of a default. The insurer will instruct the lender\n3 3 5\n",

At a foreclosure sale, the mortgagee is the original bidder,\nand if successful, the mortgagee noti\ufb01es the insurer within 60 days after the legal action\nis complete. The insurer may then pay the mortgagee, take title, and resell the property,\nor pay the mortgagee an agreed amount and let him or her sell the property to recover\nany unpaid balance.\nLand Contract Forfeitures\nA land contract is also known as an agreement for sale or a contract for deed. The land\ncontract is an executory contract, in as much as the terms have not been ful\ufb01lled. The\nbuyer receives equitable title and the seller retains legal title until the debt has been\npaid in full. The parties to a land contract are known as the vendor (seller) and vendee\n(buyer). The agreement for sale does not include a note. The promise to pay and the\nterms of the agreement are all contained in the one instrument.\nArizona statutes specify the details for remedy to the vendor under a land contract.\nOne of the choices is judicial foreclosure. As previously discussed, judicial foreclosure\ncan be time-consuming and costly. Most land contracts in Arizona have forfeiture\nclauses, which result in a faster and more economical resolution. The forfeiture clause\nallows the vendor to declare the buyer's interest forfeited, which terminates the contract\nand allows the seller to retain all payments made by the buyer.\nEquity Calculation\nThe Arizona forfeiture statute establishes the time frame a buyer has to reinstate the\nbreached contract, which is based on the amount of the buyer's equity. The statute\nalso de\ufb01nes the calculation of the equity as the total of the following:\nPercentage of Equity = Principal purchase price paid down\n+ Principal payments paid to the vendor\n+ Principal payments paid to lien holders\nThe forfeiture of the buyer's interest cannot be enforced by the seller until after the\nexpiration of the times set forth in the statute. These time limits are outlined in the table\nbelow:\nBuyer's Amount of Equity\nBuyer's Reinstatement Period\nLess than 20%\n30 days\nAt least 20%, but less than 30%\n60 days\nAt least 30%, but less than 50%\n120 days\nAt least 50%\n9 months or 270 days\nThe above time periods prior to forfeiture are referred to as the reinstatement period,\nduring which a buyer can bring payments current and protect the equity. There is no stat-\nutory redemption time after the forfeiture.\nProcess of Land Contract Forfeiture\nAt the end of the reinstatement period, the seller records a notice of election to forfeit in\nthe county where the property is located. A copy of the notice must be mailed or per-\nsonally delivered to the buyer and any other party with an interest in the property.\nThe notice must be sent at least 20 days prior to the date of the forfeiture.\nChapter 23 \u2022 Loan Satisfaction, Assumptions, Defaults, and Foreclosure\nDuring this 20-day period, the buyer can cure the default by paying the amount due\nplus penalties. If the default is cured, the seller records a notice of reinstatement with\nthe court recorder. This recording nulli\ufb01es the notice of election to forfeit.\nIf the default is not cleared within the 20 days, the vendor records an af\ufb01davit of\ncompletion of forfeiture, and the buyer's interest in the property is terminated. The\nseller retains all monies paid, as well as all property rights. Again, if the vendee/\nborrower continues to hold possession of the subject property, the vendor must evict\nthe vendee by way of a forcible detainer action.\n337\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nLoans are generally paid off in one of two ways. Either a borrower makes all of the pay-\nments required, or the proceeds of a new loan are used to pay off the existing loan\nthrough a re\ufb01nance or sale of the property. In either case, the borrower will receive a\nsatisfaction of mortgage or deed of reconveyance. When recorded, these documents re-\nmove the related lien from the property records.\nA loan assumption can be used to transfer the liability for an existing loan to a\nbuyer. A real estate loan can be assumed when a new borrower is approved by the\nlender and a formal assumption agreement is executed. In this manner, the original\nborrower (the seller) can be relieved of responsibility for the existing loan. Novation\nis a formal assumption in which a new borrower is substituted for the original maker of\nthe note.\nA property may be purchased \"subject to\" the existing loan(s) of record. In this\ncase, the seller continues to be obligated to repay these loans, even though the buyer\nwill be making payments directly to the lender(s). The seller remains responsible for\nany de\ufb01ciency.\nA default is a breach of one or more of the terms and conditions that the borrower\nagreed to in the loan and security agreements. Delinquencies are the most common form\nof default. Delinquencies are past due payments.\nProperty taxes take priority over other liens; therefore, unpaid property taxes create\na default, because the lender's security position is jeopardized.\nFailing to keep an appropriate policy of hazard insurance in force is also considered\na default. If a borrower lets his insurance policy lapse, the lender has a right to secure a\npolicy to protect his interest and charge the borrower. Failing to keep the property rea-\nsonably maintained can also create a default.\nMost lenders will work with borrowers whose loans are delinquent due to situations\nbeyond the borrower's control. Alternatives to foreclosure include forbearance and a\ndeed in lieu of foreclosure.\nForbearance is a payment arrangement that effectively forestalls or delays foreclo-\nsure action. Lenders may recast the loan, extend the loan for a longer period of time, ask\nfor more collateral, or add cosigners to a loan.\nA deed in lieu of foreclosure is used when an owner and lender wish to avoid the\nlong process of foreclosure. A deed in lieu of foreclosure is a mutual agreement in which\nthe borrower is released from liability under the terms of the loan in exchange for a quit-\nclaim deed or a regular grant deed. The \"deed in lieu\" is not as damaging to the credit\nhistory of the borrower as a foreclosure.\nForeclosure is a procedure that removes an owner's property rights. When real prop-\nerty is pledged as security for a loan, the process of selling that property as a result of the\nborrower's default is called foreclosure. The borrower's property is sold to satisfy his or\nher debt.\nThe equitable period of redemption is the period of time from the \ufb01ling of the notice\nof default to the date of the sale. The statutory period of redemption is the period after\nthe sale during which the landowner can redeem the property.\n",

Under a ju-\ndicial foreclosure, it is necessary to commence a lawsuit in state court, serve all inter-\nested parties with summons and complaints, and wait for a hearing date before a\njudge. Once a judgment is obtained, a sheriff's sale is scheduled. After the sheriff's\nsale, the debtor has 6 months in which to redeem the property.\nThe successful bidder at a judicial foreclosure receives a certi\ufb01cate of sale, which he\nor she holds until after the statutory period of redemption. At that time, the bidder\nreceives a sheriff's deed and may take possession of the property.\nLenders who take the security back because of default may still collect on the note,\nshould the security not be suf\ufb01cient to repay the debt. This is done in the form of a de-\n\ufb01ciency judgment.\nNonjudicial foreclosures are available when a trust deed has been used as the secu-\nrity instrument. When a borrower defaults, the bene\ufb01ciary (lender) noti\ufb01es the trustee of\nthe default and requests that the trustee foreclose using the power of sale clause. The\ntime required to foreclose is considerably less than in a judicial foreclosure. There is\nno statutory period of redemption; therefore, the bidder receives a trustee deed and pos-\nsession with no waiting period, while the defaulted owner or borrower has lost all prop-\nerty rights.\nThe 90-day period from the notice of default is known as the period of reinstate-\nment. During this time, a borrower may reinstate the loan by making up all back pay-\nments plus costs and bringing the loan current.\nFHA foreclosures begin with the \ufb01ling of a notice of default. If necessary, the lender\nbids on the property for the unpaid principal balance plus interest, costs, and expenses,\nthen takes title and presents FHA with an insurance claim. FHA may pay the claim in\ncash or in government bonds.\nWhen a VA loan goes into default, the lender must notify the local DVA of\ufb01ce with-\nin 3 months. The DVA may, at its option, bring the loan current by advancing funds to\nthe lender. This \"advance\" then takes priority over the lender's lien position because of\nthe subrogation rights granted to the DVA as a guarantor. In the case of a foreclosure\nsale, the lender is usually the original bidder at the auction. Assuming the lender gets\nthe property back, the lender will submit a claim to the local DVA of\ufb01ce for its losses.\nAt this point, the DVA has the option to pay the claim and take title to the property, or let\nthe lender retain title to the property and pay only the difference between the determined\nvalue of the property at the time of foreclosure and the loan balance.\nConventional loans that have private mortgage insurance (PMI) require the lender to\nnotify the insuring company within 10 days of a default. Insurers will instruct the lender\non how they wish to proceed.\nA land contract is an executory contract. The buyer receives equitable title and the\nseller retains legal title until the debt has been paid in full. Arizona statutes specify the\ndetails for remedy to the vendor under a land contract. One of the choices is judicial\nforeclosure. Most land contracts in Arizona have forfeiture clauses, which allow the ven-\ndor to declare the buyer's interest forfeited, which terminates the contract and allows the\nseller to retain all payments made by the buyer.\nThe Arizona forfeiture statute establishes the time frame a buyer has to reinstate\nthe breached contract, which is based on the amount of her equity. The forfeiture of\nthe buyer's interest cannot be enforced by the seller until after the expiration of the\ntimes set forth in the statute. The time periods prior to forfeiture are referred to as the\nreinstatement period, during which a buyer can bring payments current and protect\nthe equity. There is no statutory redemption time after the forfeiture.\nAt the end of the reinstatement period, the seller records a notice of election to for-\nfeit at least 20 days prior to the date of the forfeiture. During this 20-day period, the\nbuyer can cure the default by paying the amount due plus penalties. If the default is\ncured, the seller records a notice of reinstatement with the court recorder. If the default\nis not cleared within the 20 days, the vendor records an af\ufb01davit of completion of for-\nfeiture, and the buyer's interest in the property is terminated.\nChapter 23 \u2022 Loan Satisfaction, Assumptions, Defaults, and Foreclosure\n3 3 9\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\naf\ufb01davit of completion of forfeiture\ncerti\ufb01cate of sale\ndeed in lieu of foreclosure\ndeed of reconveyance\ndefault\nde\ufb01ciency judgment\ndelinquency\nequitable period of redemption\nequity of redemption period\nforbearance\nforcible detainer action\nforeclosure\nforfeiture clause\njudicial foreclosure\nland contract\nlis pendens\nnonjudicial foreclosure\nnotice of default\nnotice of election to forfeit\nnotice of reinstatement\nnovation\nperiod of reinstatement\npower of sale clause\nreinstatement period\nsatisfaction of mortgage\nsheriff's sale\nstatutory period of redemption\ntrustee deed\nCHECKING YOUR COMPREHENSION\n1.

T h i s section\ncovers estates in land that are less than freehold, such as leases and rental agreements.\nA leasehold is an interest in someone else's land, which allows the holder of the lease\nthe right of possession.\nAccording to the statute of frauds, a lease can be written or oral. However, a\nlease can be oral only if it is for a period of one year or less and can be performed\nwithin 1 year. For example, a lease signed on January 1 for the period January 1 to\nDecember 31 of the same year is for exactly one year and is not required to be in writ-\ning. On the other hand, a lease for the period January 1 10 December 31 but signed the\nday before the lease commenced (that is, December 31 of the prior year) cannot be\nperformed within 1 year and a lease for the period January 1 to January 1 of the fol-\nlowing year is for more than 1 year. Therefore, both of the foregoing leases must be in\nwriting.\nChapter 24 \u2022 Leasehold Estates\n343\nRental agreements for 1 year or less may be oral. Although an oral agreement is\nlegal, it could be dif\ufb01cult to enforce the tens without suf\ufb01cient proof of an agreement.\nBecause a lease is a contract, the essential elements of a contract must exist. The\nlease must identify the property (in most cases a street address is suf\ufb01cient on a\nlease, in other cases a legal description may be necessary) and must spell out the\nterms and conditions in suf\ufb01cient detail so that a clear understanding exists between\nthe parties and it shows that there was a \"meeting of the minds.\"\nThe landlord, also known as the lessor, is the owner of the property, who subordi-\nnates the rights of possession. The tenant, or lessee, gains the rights to possession and\nTransfer of Leasehold Interest\nA real estate lease is personal property, the same as fumiture, common stock, and cars.\nPersonal property is also called chattel. Even though the real estate leasehold interest\nitself is personal property, its roots are in land, and therefore, it is referred to as chattel\nr e a l .\nUnder the lease, either party may transfer his or her interest in the property unless\nprohibited in the contract. The lessor, who has given up his or her rights to possession,\nhas reversionary rights, which means possession will be retumed at the termination of\nthe lease.\nThe transfer of a leasehold interest is referred to as demise. This is not to be con-\nfused with devise, which is the transfer of real property by will.\nCLASSIFICATION OF LEASES\nAn estate for years is a lease that extends for a de\ufb01nite term. An estate for years can be\nfor 3 months or 3 years-there is no minimum or maximum time period for an estate for\nyears. A lease from January 1 to January 31, 5 years later, and a lease from January 1 to\nJanuary 31, 1 month later, are both classi\ufb01ed as estates for years because they have def-\ninite start and end dates-the hallmarks of an estate for years.\nA long-term lease may extend to 10 years and beyond. Because an estate for years\nhas a predetermined ending date, there is no reason for the lessee to give notice that he or\nshe does not intend to renew and will vacate at the expiration of the lease. However, if\nthe lease has such a provision written into the agreement, then the lessee must give no-\ntice as agreed.\nPeriodic estates, also known as estates from period to period, do not have a de\ufb01nite\nexpiration date and renew automatically at the end of each term, unless one party or the\nother gives notice of termination. For example, a tenancy from year-to-year renews at\nthe end of each year for another year, a tenancy from month-to-month renews at the\nend of each month for another month.\nAn estate at will is created when the owner permits another to occupy a property\nwithout a formal agreement. Sometimes referred to as a mother-in-law lease, it applies\nequally to a lessor who agrees to allow a lessee to retain possession of a property after\nthe more formal agreement has expired. A lessee who stays in possession on a modi\ufb01ed\nrental agreement after the expiration of a previous lease is referred to as a holdover ten-\nant. An estate at will is sometimes called a license to use one's property. An estate at will\ncan terminate by verbal notice with reasonable time given to vacate.\nAn estate at sufferance is the lowest type of estate a person can hold. A tenant at\nsufferance is distinguishable from a trespasser only by the fact that a tenant at sufferance\nat one time had the consent of the landlord to occupy the subject property, whereas a\ntrespasser never had consent. A tenant under any of the foregoing estates (that is, estate\nfor years, period to period, estate at will), whose right to occupy the subject property has\nterminated (for whatever reason) and who refuses to vacate the property, is a tenant at\n",

A person who occupies the subject property after a lender has lawfully fore-\nclosed on a defaulted loan is also a tenant at sufferance. Dependent on the nature of the\ntenancy (that is, commercial or residential) and the law that applies (that is, the Arizona\nResidential Landlord and Tenant Act or the commercial landlord tenant statutes), the land-\nlord may lock the tenant out or may be required to obtain a court order to remove a tenant\nat sufferance. See Figure 24.1 for a summary of the classi\ufb01cation of lease hold estates.\nOptions\nAn option may be included as part of a lease. An option may be an option to renew or\nextend the lease or may be an option to purchase the subject property.\nAn option to renew allows for the renewal or extension of the present lease for an-\nother speci\ufb01c period of time. The option will specify the time required to notify the les-\nsor that the lessee intends to exercise the option to renew. A lease may have a provision\nfor an automatic renewal. If it does and the lessee does not intend to renew, the lessee\nmust notify the lessor that he or she will not renew.\nSome leases contain an option to purchase. An option to purchase is an agreement\nto enter into a contract to purchase at the option of the lessee, and at a speci\ufb01ed time\nduring the lease. Buyers might want to use a lease with a purchase option for the follow-\ning reasons: (1) they do not have enough money for a down payment; (2) they need to\nbuild credit; or (3) they might not stay in the area.\nA lease-purchase is a simple lease for a speci\ufb01ed period of time, after which or\nduring which the lessor agrees to sell and the lessee has the option to purchase at an\nagreed price and terms. Lease-purchases are sometimes used when buyers are relocating\nand have not yet sold their other home and/or for the same reasons as an option to pur-\nchase. Because a lease-purchase changes the nature of the agreement between the parties\nfrom a lease to a purchase, thereby giving the tenant an equitable interest in the subject\nproperty, eviction of a tenant in a lease-purchase agreement is more dif\ufb01cult and requires\nmore time. Therefore, a seller/landlord should not enter into a lease-purchase agreement\nwithout \ufb01rst seeking competent legal advice.\nRent\nRent is the consideration paid under a leasehold estate for the use and possession of real\nproperty. Rent is paid in advance, usually on the \ufb01rst day of each month. Note the con-\ntrast between rent, which is paid in advance, and interest (such as interest on a mort-\ngage), which is paid in arrears.\nThere are different rents that are referred to in the leasing of property, speci\ufb01cally\ncontract rent and economic rent. Contract rent is the rental price stated on the lease\nChapter 24 \u2022 Leasehold Estates\n345\nagreement. Economic rent is the amount that a property would bring at current market if\nit were not under prior contract. Economic rent may be more or less than the contract\nrent, depending upon whether the market has gone up or down since the beginning of\nthe lease. Generally speaking, but not in all cases, at the beginning of a lease, the con-\ntract rent and the economic rent are the same.\nTYPES OF LEASES AND CLAUSES\nThere are many different types of lease agreements. A simple residential lease form may\nbe only one or two pages, whereas a commercial lease form may entail 20 to 40 pages of\nprovisions regarding the use of the space and payment of rental fees. Lease agreements\ntypically fall into one of the following categories, or may be a combination of more than\none of the following categories of leases.\nA gross lease is a simple lease used in most houses and apartment complexes. It\ncalls for a set rental price, such as $800 per month. Out of that gross amount of rent,\nthe property owner pays the expenses (that is, property taxes, insurance, maintenance,\nand sometimes even the utilities).\nA net lease or triple net lease is used in most commercial properties. The lease con-\ntains a provision for a square foot fee-for example, $10 per square foot. This amount is\nmultiplied by the total number of square feet to arrive at a yearly rent. For example, the\nannual rent for 1000 square feet of commercial space at S12 per square foot would be\n$12,000 per year. The yearly rent is divided by 12 for the monthly rate. The monthly rent\non the previous example would be $1,000 per month plus expenses. If the rental space\nconsists of only one building and one tenant, then the tenant will pay all expenses for the\nproperty (including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, utilities, and so on).\nIf the rental property consists of two or more tenants, the tenants are still responsible for\nall expenses, but the amount of expenses is divided between the tenants.\nTypically, the expenses are apportioned according to the amount of space the tenant\nleases. For example, if there were three tenants occupying a 3000-square-foot building\nand each tenant occupied 1000 square feet, then each tenant would pay one-third of the\ntotal expenses. As a second example, if the same 3000-square-foot building is occupied\nby two tenants, one occupying 1000 square feet and the other occupying 2000 square\nfeet, then the former will pay one-third of the expenses and the latter will pay two-thirds\nof the expenses. In this way, the lessor (landlord) receives a speci\ufb01ed amount of rent and\nthe lessee(s) pay all of the expenses for the property.\nA ground lease is a long-term lease for the use of land. Improvements to the land\n(such as buildings, and so on) become a part of the real property. A ground lease is\ntypically used for a recreational site, agricultural land (that is, to grow crops), or ranch-\ning (grazing rights), but it may also be used for a shopping center or commercial\nA variable lease provides that the rent may increase during the term of the lease.\nVariable leases include an index lease and a graduated lease. An index lease allows\nfor periodic increases in base rental fees based on a predetermined guideline, such as\nthe Consumer Price Index (CPI). A graduated lease allows for periodic increases in\nrent at predetermined intervals and predetermined rates. For example, this type of\nlease may provide that rent increases each year (or some other period of time) by a\nset amount (for example, $100) or by a percentage (such as 3 percent).\nA percentage lease is a commercial lease in which the tenant pays a percentage of\nthe gross income received by the tenant, in addition to rent. Typically, retail centers and\nshopping malls are triple net leases, meaning that the tenant pays: (1) a base amount of\nrent, (2) a percentage of all of the property expenses, and (3) a percentage of the tenant's\nOil or gas leases consist of a \ufb02at fee for the exploration of gas or oil and a royalty if\nany i s found.\n",

A rooftop\nlease is typically used for advertising space (such as billboards) or communication\ntowers.\nSale and leaseback leases are used after a person has developed a building and\nwants his or her working capital available for other developments. In this case, the\nowner would sell the building and lease it back from the new owner. This type of\nlease is normally a long-term lease.\nAgricultural Leases\nOwners of agricultural land generally enter into one of two types of agreements with a\ntenant: cash rent or sharecropping.\nSharecropping is a lease between an agricultural landowner and a tenant, whereby\nthe landowner provides the land and may also provide equipment in retum for the ten-\nant's planting, maintaining, and harvesting a crop. The proceeds are then divided (not\nnecessarily equally) between the tenant and the landowner. The tenant is called a\nsharecropper.\nCash rent is a lease between an agricultural landowner and a tenant, whereby the\ntenant pays the landowner a speci\ufb01ed amount of money in advance in exchange for the\nright of the tenant to use the agricultural land to plant, maintain, and harvest a crop upon\nthe land. All of the proceeds from the crop belong to the tenant.\nLease Clauses\nA lease may include one or more of the following common lease clauses:\n1. An option clause may give the tenant the right to extend the lease for a speci\ufb01ed\nperiod of time (that is, an option to renew/extend) and/or may give the tenant the right\nto purchase the subject property (that is, an option to purchase).\n2. Hold harmless clause. State law may restrict a residential landlord's ability to require\nthe tenant to hold the landlord harmless and/or cover the landlord for any liability\nincurred by the landlord, but a commercial lease typically transfers all liability for the\npremises to the tenant and requires the tenant to indemnify (reimburse) the landlord\nfor any and all liability incurred by the landlord.\n3. A sale clause is typically found only in residential leases. This clause allows the\ntenant or the landlord to terminate the lease in the event the subject property is\nsold.\n4. A defeasance clause in a mortgage or deed of trust renders those documents null and\nvoid upon complete payment of the promissory note. Similarly, a defeasance clause in\na lease may terminate the lease upon the occurrence of speci\ufb01ed events, such as\ndestruction of the premises or condemnation.\nTRANSFER OF LEASEHOLD ESTATES\nUnless otherwise stated in the lease, either the tenant or the landlord may freely transfer\nhis or her rights. A landlord may sell the subject property, and the tenant may assign the\nlease. In practice, however, virtually all leases, residential or commercial, restrict the ten-\nant's right to assign or sublet all or part of the leased premises without the landlord's\napproval.\nTransfer\nThe landlord/owner may freely transfer ownership rights anytime during the lease. The\nnew owner, however, takes ownership subject to the existing lease. This means the new\nChapter 24 \u2022 Leasehold Estates\nFIGURE 24.2\nLease Assignment\n347\nLessor\nl e a s e s\n$1,000\nASSIGNMENT\n> L e s s e e A -\nw h o a s s i g n s\nl e a s e t o\nAssignee B pays $1,000 directly to Lessor\nAssignee B\nlandlord cannot cancel the lease (unless there is a sale clause, as discussed above) or\nchange any of the terms of the lease unless the tenant consents.\nAssignment\nA tenant may freely assign a lease unless the lease prohibits it. Typically, the lease will\nprohibit assignment by the tenant without landlord approval. Even when assignment is\npermitted, the original lessee still has liability unless released by the lessor, or unless\nthere is a novation (see below). The terms of the lease generally remain unchanged.\nAn assignment is considered a permanent change. Under an assignment, the new lessee\npays the rent directly to the lessor. (See Figure 24.2)\nNovation\nA novation is a complete substitution of parties. A novation, as it applies to leases, makes\nthe new tenant/lessee fully responsible for the lease. In addition, it completely releases the\noriginal tenant/lessee from the lease. The same result would be achieved if the original lease\nwere terminated, thereby terminating the original lessee's liability, and a new lease executed\nby the new lessee, thereby making the new lessee fully responsible for the new lease.\nSubleasing or Sandwich Lease\nAs stated above, a lessee can assign or sublease all or part of the leased premises unless\nthe original lease prohibits it. In a sublease, the original lessee remains fully responsible\nto the lessor under the original lease. The lessee, who becomes the sublessor, may sub-\nlease all or a portion of the leased premises for any amount of rent (higher or lower) and\nany amount of the time remaining on the lease. The sublessee makes the payments to the\nsublessor, who in tum pays the lessor according to the original lease. This arrangement\nis called a sandwich lease because the sublessor is \"sandwiched\" in the middle between\nthe sublessee and the lessor.

A lease can be written or oral. However, a lease can\nbe oral only if it is for a period of l year or less and can be performed within\n1 year. Because a lease is a contract, the essential elements of a contract must exist.\nThe landlord, or lessor, is the owner of the property, who gives up the rights of pos-\nsession. The tenant, or lessee, gains the rights to possession and quiet enjoyment. A\nreal estate lease is personal property, but its roots are in land, so it is referred to as chat-\ntel real.\nUnder the lease, either party may transfer his or her interest in the property unless\nprohibited in the contract. The lessor, who has given up his or her rights to possession,\nhas reversionary rights, which means possession will be returned at the termination of\nthe lease. The transfer of a leasehold interest is referred to as demise.\nAn estate for years is a lease that extends for a de\ufb01nite term. Periodic estates do not\nhave a de\ufb01nite expiration date and renew automatically at the end of each term, unless\none party or the other gives notice of termination. An estate at will is created when the\nowner permits another to occupy a property without a formal agreement. A lessee who\nstays in possession on a modi\ufb01ed rental agreement after the expiration of a previous\nlease is referred t o as a holdover tenant.\nAn estate at sufferance is the lowest type of estate a person can hold. A tenant at\nsufferance is distinguishable from a trespasser only by the fact that a tenant at sufferance\nat one time had the consent of the landlord to occupy the subject property, whereas a\nAn option may be included as part of a lease. An option to renew allows for the\nrenewal or extension of the present lease for another speci\ufb01c period of time. Some\nleases contain an option to purchase, which is an agreement to enter into a contract\nto purchase at the option of the lessee, and at a speci\ufb01ed time during the lease. A\nlease-purchase is a simple lease for a speci\ufb01ed period of time, after which or during\nwhich the lessor agrees to sell and the lessee has the option to purchase at an agreed\nprice and terms.\nRent is the consideration paid under a leasehold estate for the use and possession of\nreal property. Rent is paid in advance. Contract rent is the rental price stated on the lease\nagreement. Economic rent is the amount that a property would bring at current market if\ni t were not under prior contract.\nThere are many different types of lease agreements. Most of these are explained in\nthe body of the text. Some lease agreements are described brie\ufb02y below.\nA gross lease is a simple lease used in most houses and apartment complexes. It\ncalls for a set rental price. Out of that gross amount of rent, the property owner pays\nthe expenses.\nA net lease or triple net lease is used in most commercial properties. The lease con-\ntains a provision for a square foot fee. This amount is multiplied by the total number of\nsquare feet t o arrive at a yearly rent.\nA ground lease is a long-term lease for the use of land.\nOwners of agricultural land generally enter into one of two types of agreements with\na tenant: cash rent or sharecropping\nA lease may include one or more of the following common lease clauses: an option\nclause, a hold harmless clause, a sale clause, or a defeasance clause. These clauses are\ndescribed in the body of the text.\nUnless otherwise stated in the lease, either the tenant or the landlord may freely\ntransfer his or her rights. The landlord/owner may freely transfer ownership rights any-\ntime during the lease. The new owner, however, takes ownership subject to the existing\nlease. This means the new landlord cannot cancel the lease or change the tenns unless\nt h e t e n a n t consents.\nChapter 24 \u2022 Leasehold Estates\n349\nA tenant may freely assign a lease unless the lease prohibits it.

Investing in real property may be as simple as buying a piece of raw land.\nholding it for some period of time, and (hopefully) selling it for a pro\ufb01t-\"management\"\nis unnecessary for this type of investment. On the other hand, an apartment complex or a\nsingle-family home that will be rented to a tenant both require \"management\" of the real\nproperty and of the tenant during the holding period. Real estate investors may not have\nthe skills, time, or desire to manage one or more of the properties that they own.\nChapter 25 \u2022 Property Management and Arizona Landlord-Tenant Acts\n353\nProperty Managers and Investors\nEnter the property manager. A property manager is a person or company who manages\nrental property for someone else; property managers may or may not be licensed. An\ninvestor hires a property manager to ef\ufb01ciently manage the investor's properties and\nto make a pro\ufb01t for the investor during the holding period. An investor also counts\non a property manager to protect, preserve, maintain, and possibly even improve the in-\nvestment property during the holding period, so that the investor receives the highest\npossible retur when the investment property is ultimately sold.\nInvestors with many properties sometimes have their own staffs to manage the prop-\nerties. Typically, investors with few properties either manage the properties themselves,\nor hire professional property managers (although there are some exceptions). Because of\nthe growth of absentee owners (owners/investors who do not live in the state where the\ninvestment property is located), many real estate \ufb01rms have opened property manage-\nment divisions.\nCategories of Management\nAs is the case with real estate sales, property management is divided into two categories:\nresidential and commercial, with each category having several subcategories. Manage-\nment of a large apartment complex is very different from management of single-family\nhomes, exclusive luxury homes, or furnished seasonal rentals. Similarly, management of\na strip mall is very different from management of a shopping center or an industrial\nbuilding. Nevertheless, all property management is governed by Arizona statutes that\nset forth the requirements for the following:\n1. What must and may be included in a property management agreement.\n2. Property management company trust accounts and the handling of the owners' and\ntenants' money.\n3. Record-keeping requirements.\n4. Payment of \"\ufb01nder's fees.\" A \ufb01nder's fee is a fee paid to a person for introducing\nor arranging an introduction between the parties to a transaction involving the\nrental of an apartment unit.\nLicensing\nNegotiating leases, advertising rental property, collecting rent, or otherwise managing\nreal property easily and clearly falls within the de\ufb01nition of the job of a real estate bro-\nker, which requires a real estate license.\nExceptions\nThere are some exceptions, however, and not everyone who does one or more of these\nactivities has to have a license. A complete list of licensing exemptions is included in\nChapter I. A partial list of persons who are exempt from having real estate licenses\nfollows:\n\u2022 A natural person dealing with his or her own property\n\u2022 A business acting through its of\ufb01cers, partners, and so on, dealing with property\nowned by the business, provided the persons doing the real estate activities do not\nreceive compensation speci\ufb01cally for those activities\n\u2022 A person holding a valid power of attorney, for a speci\ufb01c purpose in an isolated\ntransaction and not as a method of conducting a real estate business\n\u2022 An attomey in the performance of the attorney's duties\n",

Title 32 of the Arizona Revised\nStatutes sets forth the requirements for property management trust accounts.\n\u2022 All property management accounts must be designated as trust accounts and must\ninclude descriptive wording in the trust account title such as: trust account, \ufb01duciary\naccount, in trust for, trustee for, \ufb01duciary for, and so on.\n\u2022 A property management trust account is required for all owner's monies, unless the\nowner directs the broker to deposit the monies directly into the owner's account.\n\u2022 Whether or not funds are deposited directly into the owner's account, the broker must\nnot have access to the owner's account.\n\u2022 Trust accounts may be interest bearing, but if the account ears interest, the property\nmanagement agreement must state who receives the interest and how often it will be paid.\n\u2022 The designated broker for a property management \ufb01rm may authorize either a licensee\nor an unlicensed natural person in the direct employ of the broker to transfer monies or to\nbe a signatory on the property management \ufb01nn's trust accounts. The designation of a\nlicensed or unlicensed person to transfer monies or to be a signatory on trust accounts\ndoes not lessen the broker's responsibility or liability for any monies handled.\n\u2022 The broker may require dual signatures on checks and may use a facsimile signature\naccording to the broker's business policies.\n\u2022 Within 3 banking days after receiving monies that are not subject to dispute or\ncontingency, the property management \ufb01rm must deposit the monies in either the\nowner's direct account or the property management \ufb01rm's trust account for the bene\ufb01t\nof the owner.\nProperty Management Records\nThe Arizona Department of Real Estate regularly audits brokers without notice. A sig-\nni\ufb01cant portion of the audit relates to record-keeping requirements. The statute sets forth\nthe record-keeping requirements and mandates that property management \ufb01rms:\n\u2022 Keep the residential rental agreement and related documents for l year from the\nexpiration of the rental agreement OR until the rental agreement and documents are\ngiven to the owner at the termination of any property management agreement.\n\u2022 Keep records at the broker's main of\ufb01ce or at an off-site storage location in this state,\nif the broker provides ADRE with prior written noti\ufb01cation of the street address of the\noff-site storage location.\n\u2022 Keep records of all \ufb01nder's fees that are paid to tenants for 3 years after the payment\nis made OR until the records are given to the owner at the termination of the property\nmanagement agreement.\n\u2022 Keep al \ufb01nancial records pertaining to clients for at least 3 years from the date each\ndocument was executed.\n\u2022 Consecutively number or \ufb01le all signed property management agreements in\ncompliance with a system that is orderly, easily accessible, and consistent with\ngenerally accepted professional standards of the industry.\nChapter 25 \u2022 Property Management and Arizona Landlord-Tenant Acts\n\u2022 Maintain cach nonresidential real estate lease agreement and the transaction folder\nin which it is kept in a chronological log or other systematic manner that is easily\naccessible b y the commissioner.\n\u2022 Number on-site residential rental transaction folders according to dwelling unit\nnumber o r other systematic manner.\n\u2022 Must make available within a reasonable amount of time all records relative to\nproperty management accounts for audit purposes, on request by ADRE.\nThe designated broker is required to review and initial all nonresidential leases (and also\nall listings and purchase agreements) within 5 days.\n\u2022 Only the designated broker or the broker's authorized real estate licensee, on behalf\nof the broker, may sign nonresidential rental agreements.\n\u2022 Fully executed residential lease agreements are not required to be reviewed and\ninitialed.\nEach rental agreement (residential or nonresidential) executed by a property manager\nmust include a provision that clearly states the disposition of any tenant deposits.\nFinder's Fee\nWe are repeatedly taught that paying all or part of a real estate commission to a person\nwho does not have a real estate license is illegal for both the payer and the receiver\u2014and\nthat is generally true. However, payment of a \ufb01nder's fee is an exception to this rule. A\nproperty manager, property management \ufb01rm, or an owner may:\n1. Pay a \ufb01nder's fee to an unlicensed person who is a tenant in an apartment complex\nmanaged by the \ufb01rm or owned by the owner.\n2. Authorize a residential leasing agent or manager to deliver a \ufb01nder's fee to an\nunlicensed person who is a tenant in an apartment complex managed by the\nresidential leasing agent or manager. A residential leasing agent or manager may\nnot receive a \ufb01nder's fee, but can receive a bonus.\nA \ufb01nder's fee cannot exceed S100 and must be given as a credit toward or reduction in\nthe tenant's monthly rent. A tenant may receive a \ufb01nder's fee only six times in any 12-month\nperiod. The unlicensed person cannot advertise or otherwise promote the person's services in\nprocuring or assisting to procure prospective lessors or tenants of apartment units.\nLANDLORD/TENANT STATUTES\nEntire books have been devoted to a thorough discussion of residential landlord/tenant\nlaw; other books are devoted to a discussion of commercial landlord/tenant law. The fol-\nlowing is intended merely to familiarize you with the fundamental principles of both and\nto cover the issues that most commonly arise.\nArizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act\nIn August 1972, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws met\nin San Francisco, Califomia, and \ufb01nalized the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant\nAct. To date, a total of 15 states have adopted all or part of the uniform act. In 1973,\nArizona became the second state to adopt the uniform act. It is now formally known\nas the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.\nThe Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act is state law. Consequently, if the\nact applies, unless preempted by federal law, it is applicable statewide. This means that it\napplies equally in Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Tombstone, Bisbee, and Tubac.

'Dwelling unit' excludes real property used to accommodate\na mobile home, unless the mobile home is rented or leased by the landlord.\"\nExceptions\nIn short, the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act applies to most residential\nrental property. It also applies to mobile homes if the tenant is renting both the mobile\nhome and the land under it. If a person rents just the mobile home lot, that occupancy is\ngovered by the Mobile Home Act, so the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act\ndoes not apply. The Act also does not apply to hotels, commercial, or industrial rental\nproperty. These properties are controlled by a body of statutes that fall under the heading\n\"Landlord and Tenant,\" which is truly unfortunate because many people (attorneys\nincluded) mistakenly believe that these statutes apply to residential rentals.\nTo clarify, there are four separate sets of statutes that address the landlord/tenant re-\nlationship in Arizona. They are:\n\u2022 Arizona Residential Landlord Tenant Act, which applies to almost all residential\nunits (see \"exclusions,\" below); referred to below as the \"Residential Act\"\n\u2022 The Arizona Mobile Home Parks Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, known as the\nMobile Home Act, which applies to the rental of mobile home lots (not the\nmobile homes themselves)\n\u2022 The Recreational Vehicle Long-Term Rental Space Act, which applies to rental\nof recreational vehicle rental spaces for more than 6 months\n\u2022 The Commercial Landlord/Tenant statutes, which apply to commercial rental\npropenty\nDifferences between Statutes\nWhy is the issue of whether the Residential Act applies important? The courts tend to\nfavor residential tenants, but do not necessarily favor commercial tenants. In addition,\nthe Residential Act gives residential tenants certain protections that commercial ten-\nants do not have (such as limiting the amount of security deposit that a landlord\nmay compel a tenant to pay) and revokes some rights of landlords that would otherwise\nbe available. For example, the Residential Act precludes lockout by the landlord and\ndistraint for rent.\nDistraint is forcing the tenant to pay rent or other \ufb01nancial obligations by seizing the\nleased premises and/or personal property inside the leased premises. The Residential Act\nabolished distraint for rent, but the Commercial Landlord/Tenant statutes still permit it.\nIn short, the Residential Act is clearly more favorable to residential tenants than the\nCommercial Landlord/Tenant statutes are to commercial tenants. The Residential Act\nand the Mobile Home Act are essentially two separate sets of consumer protection\nlaws, designed to protect residential tenants. You cannot elect, by written agreement\nor otherwise, to make the Residential Act or the Mobile Home Act not applicable to\nthe rental of residential property. The legislative intent would be easily frustrated if land-\nlords could merely opt out of the Residential Act or the Mobile Home Act.\nChapter 25 \u2022 Property Management and Arizona Landlord-Tenant Acts\n359\nSummary of the Residential Act\nThe most essential facts to remember about the Residential Act are:\n\u2022 The Residential Act applies to the rental of residential dwelling units.\n\u2022 The Residential Act does not apply to:\n\u2022 Residence at a public or private facility relating to detention, education,\ncounseling, or religious services\n\u2022 Occupancy in conjunction with a contract of sale\n\u2022 Occupancy by a member of a frateral or social organization\n\u2022 Transient occupancy in a hotel, motel, or recreational lodging\n\u2022 On-site managers\n\u2022 Occupancy by an owner of a condominium unit or a holder of a proprietary lease\nin a cooperative\n\u2022 Occupancy in public housing\n\u2022 The Residential Act is state law and applies everywhere in Arizona, unless pre-\nempted by federal law.\n\u2022 A written rental agreement is not required; an oral rental agreement is enforceable.\nHowever, rental agreements for more than 1 year must be written (a month-\nto-month rental agreement that continues for more than 1 year need not be\nwritten).\n\u2022 Whether or not a written rental agreement is used, landlords must notify the tenant,\nin writing:\n\u2022 That a copy of the Residential Act is available free of charge from the Arizona\nSecretary of State's of\ufb01ce\n\u2022 That the tenant may be present during the move-out inspection\n\u2022 O f the purpose of nonrefundable charges, fees, and/or deposits\n\u2022 Of the name and address of the manager (if any) and owner or owner's agent\n\u2022 That the landlord holds a real estate salesperson or broker license (if applicable)\n\u2022 Whether or not a written rental agreement is used, landlords must provide tenants\nwith a written copy of the following:\n\u2022 A move-in inspection checklist specifying any existing damage or defects\n\u2022 The state-approved pool safety notice, if the property has a pool or spa\n\u2022 The federally approved lead-based paint hazard information pamphlet, a copy\nof any reports (if any), and disclosure of any known lead-based paint hazards,\nif the property was built before 1978 or has lead-based paint\n\u2022 Out-of-state owners must have an in-state statutory agent.\n\u2022 All residential landlords (in state and out of state) must register residential rental\nproperty with the county assessor.\n\u2022 An amount equal to 1 1/2 months' rent is the maximum amount of security deposit\nthe landlord may collect as security.\n\u2022 Security does not include a reasonable fee for cleaning or redecorating.\n\u2022 Tenant must be shown landlord's rules and regulations before rental agreement\nis signed.\n\u2022 Landlord must give residential tenant at least 2 days advance notice before entering\ndwelling, unless an emergency necessitates immediate access.\n\u2022 If the landlord fails to make a repair after 10 days' written notice, the tenant\nmay repair and deduct from rent the greater of S300 or one-half month's rent.\n\u2022 S-Day Notice to Pay or Quit must be served on tenant to start eviction of tenant\nfor nonpayment of rent.\n\u2022 S-Day Notice must be served on tenant to start eviction of tenant for noncom-\npliance materially affecting health and safety.\n",

An investor looks to a property manager to ef\ufb01-\nciently manage the investor's properties and to make a pro\ufb01t for the investor during the\nholding period. An investor also counts on a property manager to protect, preserve, and\nmaintain the investment property during this period. Property management is divided\ninto two categories: residential and commercial.\nNegotiating leases, advertising rental property, collecting rent, or otherwise manag-\ning real property requires a real estate license.\nThe list of exempt persons who do not need to have a real estate license includes\n(but is not limited to): a natural person dealing with his or her own property; a person\nwho manages a hotel, motel, or recreational vehicle park; and a person who receives a\n\ufb01nder's fee.\nThe Commissioner may also grant an exemption from the license requirements to\nany corporation that applies for an exemption if certain prerequisites apply.\nA property management agreement is an agreement between the owner of the prop-\nerty and the property manager. It establishes the rights and obligations of the parties.\nArizona law requires that certain provisions be included in all property management\nagreements. For example, the agreement must be written in clear, unambiguous lan-\nguage, it must state all material terms and conditions of the property management \ufb01rm's\nChapter 25 \u2022 Property Management and Arizona Landlord-Tenant Acts\nobligations to the property owner, and it must specify a beginning and an ending date.\nA full list of the requirements is included in the body of the text.\nA property management agreement is not assignable to another licensee or licensed\nentity without the express written consent of the property owner.\nUpon termination of a property management agreement, the property management\n\ufb01rm must immediately provide the owner with all originals or other copies of all rental\nagreements, and all building plans, inspection reports, contracts, keys, and the like.\nThere are different time limits for providing other \ufb01nancial information.\nMany requirements exist for property management trust accounts. A property man-\nagement trust account is required for all owner's monies, unless the owner directs the\nbroker to deposit the monies directly into the owner's account. Trust accounts may be\ninterest bearing, but if the account earns interest, the property management agreement\nmust state who receives the interest and how often it will be paid.\nThere are also many record-keeping requirements and mandates that property man-\nagement \ufb01rms must follow. Property management \ufb01rms must keep the residential rental\nagreement and related documents for i year from the expiration of the rental agreement\nor until the rental agreement and documents are given to the owner at the termination of\nany property management agreement. They must also keep all \ufb01nancial records pertain-\ning to clients for at least 3 years from the date each document was executed. Each rental\nagreement (residential or nonresidential) executed by a property manager must include a\nprovision that clearly states the disposition of any tenant deposits.\nPaying all or part of a real estate commission to a person who does not have a real\nestate license is illegal. However, a property manager, property management \ufb01rm, or an\nowner may pay a \ufb01nder's fee to an unlicensed person who is a tenant in an apartment\ncomplex managed by the \ufb01rm or owned by the owner. They may also authorize a res-\nidential leasing agent or manager to deliver a \ufb01nder's fee to an unlicensed person who\nis a tenant in an apartment complex managed by the residential leasing agent or\nmanager.\nThe Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act applies to the rental of dwelling\nunits. Four separate sets of statutes address the landlord-tenant relationship in Arizona.\nThey are: the Arizona Residential Landlord Tenant Act, the Mobile Home Act, the Recre-\national Vehicle Long-Term Rental Space Act, and the Commercial Landlord/Tenant Statutes.\nSome of the most essential facts to remember about the Residential Act are: The\nResidential Act applies to the rental of residential dwelling units. An amount equal to\n1 1/2 months' rent is the maximum amount of security deposit the landlord may collect\nas security. The tenant must be shown the landlord's rules and regulations before a rental\nagreement is signed. The Residential Act prohibits distraint for rent. A residential land-\nlord cannot \"lock out\" a residential tenant. A complete list of essential facts is included\nin the body of the text.\nSome of the most essential facts to remember about the Commercial Landlord/Tenant\nStatutes are: There is no maximum security deposit; the tenant has no right to a 5-day notice;\nthe landlord may \"lock out\" the tenant; and distraint for rent is pennissible.\n361\nIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nArizona Residential Landlord and\nTenant Act\nCommercial Landlord/Tenant\nStatutes\nconstructive eviction\ndistraint\ndwelling unit\neviction\n\ufb01nder's fee\ninvestor\n",

Prior to the Civil War, the courts refused to recognize any rights for\npersons of African descent, whether they were slaves or free. The federal govemment\ndid nothing to prohibit discrimination, and even those states that had abolished slavery\ntreated African Americans as inferior.\nLegislation and Court Cases\nIn 1866, the Reconstruction Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which guar-\nanteed property rights to all citizens regardless of race.

Therefore, the 1866 Act was ine\ufb02ec-\ntive in combating private discrimination.\nIn 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court made its infamous ruling in Plessy v Ferguson,\nwhich held that the enforcement of racial segregation of private or public facilities did\nnot violate the U.S. Constitution as long as the separate facilities were equal. This\nseparate but equal ruling permitted institutionalized segregation in the United States.\nThe Plessy case was not overruled until 1954, almost six decades later.\nFinally, in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered its landmark decision in\nBrown v. Board of Education, reversing the separate but equal decision in Plessy.\nThe Brown case outlawed segregation in schools and marked the beginning of the\nend of the era of legalized segregation.\nTen years later, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited\ndiscrimination in programs receiving federal \ufb01nancial assistance, but had little impact\nin the housing market. The Act says:\n(No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be\nexcluded from participation in, be denied the bene\ufb01ts of, or be subjected to discrimination\nunder any program or activity receiving Federal \ufb01nancial assistance.\nBirth of Modern Fair Housing\nThe real change in fair housing came in 1968, a year that is considered the birth of mod-\nem fair housing. Two historic events occurred that year that forever changed the housing\nmarket.\nFirst, in April, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Title VIII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1968). This Act bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, re-\nligion, and national origin in most types of housing transactions. In 1974, the 1968 Act\nwas amended to include the ban on discrimination on the basis of sex. The Act also\ncontains a variety of remedies to attack housing discrimination, including private\nAbout the same time that Congress approved the 1968 Act, the Supreme Court ren-\ndered its decision in the case of Jones v. Mayer, in which Jones, a black man, com-\nplained that the Alfred H. Mayer Co. refused to sell him a house because he was\nblack. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Jones. This landmark decision resurrected\nthe 1866 Civil Rights Act and held that the Act banned govemmental and private racial\ndiscrimination in housing. This case also noted that the Fair Housing Act allowed some\nexceptions (discussed below). This case, however, was brought under the 1866 Civil\nRights Act, which made no exceptions. The \ufb01nal holding of the case is that, where\nrace is involved, no exceptions apply.\nEqual Opportunities\nThe Fair Housing Act was amended in 1972 by a requirement that equal opportunity\nposters be displayed in brokerages, mortgage companies, and new home sites. Failure\nto display the Equal Housing Opportunities poster may, in and of itself, be considered\nby HUD to be evidence of discriminatory practices.\nFAIR HOUSING ACT\nThe Fair Housing Act was adopted by Congress in 1968, and amended in 1974 and\n1988. The Act, as amended, bans housing discrimination for these seven protected\nclasses: race, color religion, national origin, sex, handicaps, and familial status. The\nAct also establishes unlawful acts, describes exceptions to the Act, and de\ufb01nes impor-\nt a n t terms.\nChapter 26 \u2022 Fair Housing\n367\nUnlawful Acts\nUnder the Fair Housing Acts of 1968 and 1988 it is unlawful:\n1. To refuse to sell or rent housing to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,\nnational origin, handicap, or familial status\n2. To refuse to negotiate for housing because of race, color, religion, sex, national\norigin, handicap, or familial status\n3. To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges for sale or\nrental of housing because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap,\nor familial status\n4. To print or publish any notice or advertisement concerning the sale or rental of a\ndwelling that indicates any preference or discrimination based on race, color, religion,\nsex, national origin, handicap, or familial status\n5. To falsely deny that housing is available for inspection, sale, or rental because of\nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or familial status\n6. For pro\ufb01t, to persuade any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representation\nregarding the entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race,\ncolor, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or familial status (blockbusting)\nExceptions\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 does not apply to the sale or rental of commercial or in-\ndustrial properties. The Act also exempts:\n\u2022 Owner-occupied buildings with no more than four units\n\u2022 Single-family housing sold or rented without the use of a broker\n\u2022 Housing operated by organizations and private clubs that limit occupancy to their\nmembers\nThe exemption for the sale or rental of single-family homes applies only when these\nthree requirements are met:\n1. The home is owned by an individual who does not own more than three such homes\nat one time, and who does not sell more than one such home every 2 years.\n2. A real estate broker or salesperson is not involved in the transaction.\n3. Discriminatory advertising is not used.\nThe rental of rooms or units is exempted from the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in an\nowner-occupied one-family to four-family dwelling\nReligious organizations that offer housing only to people of their religion may do so\nas long as membership is not restricted on the basis of race, color, or national origin.\nAlso, private clubs that offer room rental (when this is not their main business) may\nlegally discriminate against nonmembers, provided that membership in the club does not\nviolate the 1968 law.\nAdvertising material for the sale or lease of real property cannot indicate that the\nproperty is available to or not available to people of speci\ufb01c protected classes.\nImportant Terms\nBlockbusting is the illegal practice of inducing panic selling in a neighborhood for prof-\nit, based on the introduction of minority homeowners into a neighborhood. The Fair\nHousing Act of 1968 prohibits blockbusting.\n",

This does not, however, include current illegal use of, or addiction\nto, a controlled substance. It does include those af\ufb02icted with AIDS or HIV.\nFamilial status means one or more individuals (under the age of 18) living with either:\n\u2022 A parent or legal guardian, or\n\u2022 A designee holding written permission of a parent or legal guardian for the child\nor children to live with him or her\nThis includes legal custody of a person who is pregnant or in the process of securing\nlegal custody of a minor.\nModi\ufb01cations\nIt is against the 1988 law to refuse to permit a handicapped person, at his or her own\nexpense, to make minor modi\ufb01cations to an existing premise. The law also requires own-\ners to make reasonable accommodations necessary to afford a person equal opportunity to\nuse and enjoy a dwelling. If, for example, an apartment complex has a rule that no pets\nare allowed in the complex, it will be necessary to modify that regulation regarding\nSeeing Eye dogs or other assistive animals. Assistive animals are not considered pets.\nCentain design changes may be necessary in the construction of new multifamily\nbuildings available in order to make the property accessible for handicapped persons.\nA multifamily building is de\ufb01ned as four or more units. Therefore, the construction\nof a two- or three-storey housing unit that has elevators must have the \ufb02oors equipped\nfor wheelchair access. The doors must be wider and light switches and thermostats must\nbe reachable by persons in wheelchairs. Baths must have reinforced walls for grab rails\nand the kitchen must be large enough to allow wheelchair maneuverability. If, however,\nthere are no elevators, only the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor must be so equipped.\nSenior Housing\nAge is not a protected class. Instead, the Act exempts housing for older persons from\nthe familial status provision provided that the area or facility is intended for and solely\noccupied by persons 62 years of age or older, or at least one person in 80 percent of the\nhouseholds is 55 years or older. Also, the facilities and services must be speci\ufb01cally\ndesigned to meet the physical and social needs of older persons.\nREMEDIES\nRemedies for violations of Civil Rights laws vary depending on the form of complaint.\nMost cases, by law, are presented to the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD). The complaint must be \ufb01led within I year of the violation.\nChapter 26 \u2022 Fair Housing\n369\nHUD has 30 days to investigate the complaint. If the violation is one of race or color,\nthe complaint is \ufb01led with a federal district court. HUD may defer to the State Attorney\nGeneral's of\ufb01ce. In Arizona, the Arizona Atomey General investigates and prosecutes\nfair housing complaints.\nIf the state has laws substantially the same as the provisions of 1968 Fair Housing\nAct laws, HUD will notify the state and tum over the case to the state. If the state acts on\nthe complaint within 30 days, HUD loses jurisdiction unless \"justice demands\" HUD'S\ncontinued interest in the matter.\nWhen HUD is involved in the complaint, it seeks relief through conferences, con-\nciliation, and persuasion in order to satisfy the complaint. HUD will attempt to seek ac-\ncess or similar housing, out-of-pocket expenses, and money for wounded pride. HUD\nhas been successful in negotiating a greater number of complaints in recent years.\nAlso, with the 1988 amendments, HUD can \ufb01le a formal charge and refer the complaint\nto an administrative law judge, unless either party elects a jury trial in a civil court. The\nadministrative law judge can impose substantial penalties, ranging from $11,000 for the\n\ufb01rst offense to $27,300 for a second violation within 5 years, and SS5,000 for further\nviolations within 7 years.\nA party may elect civil action in federal court at any time within 2 years of the dis-\ncriminatory act. For federal court cases, unlimited punitive damages can be awarded in\naddition to actual damages.\nIf the attomey general believes there is reasonable cause to suspect that a person or\ngroup has engaged in a patter or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of\nthe rights granted by the federal fair housing laws, the attorney general can \ufb01le a civil\naction in any federal district court. Civil penalties may result in an amount not to exceed\n$50,000 for a \ufb01rst violation and an amount not to exceed $100,000 for a second and\nsubsequent violations.\nAMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was the \ufb01rst comprehensive American\ncivil rights law for people with disabilities, and affects every employer, business, and\npublic service, including real estate. The ADA attempts to achieve equal treatment,\nbut does not guarantee equality to all. The ADA differs from other laws as it is\naimed at reasonable fairness to each individualized situation rather than a blanket\napproach to all disabled groups. For example, an employer does not have to create a\njob for a disability. However, the employer must give consideration to a reasonable\namendment to some existing job requirements for a quali\ufb01ed disabled person who\nFor many people, Title I. Employment is the most signi\ufb01cant section of the ADA,\nbecause it sets the tone and criteria for independence and equality for the disabled.

Has a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major\nlife activities\n2. Has a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or\nmore major life activities\n3.

By including a record of\nimpairment in the de\ufb01nition, the ADA prohibits discrimination against an individual be-\ncause of a previous impairment.\nAn example of someone meeting the de\ufb01nition because of a record would be an in-\ndividual with a history of cancer. Another example would be someone misdiagnosed as\nhaving a particular disability.\nRegarded\nWhen others treat an individual as having an impairment, the individual is covered by\nADA.

The ADA, unlike other civil rights laws, does not\nset quotas or require special preferences for the disabled, nor does it guarantee equal\nresults.\nThe most signi\ufb01cant feature of Title I is the entitlement of a disabled applicant or\ncurrent employee of reasonable accommodation to carry out the essential duties of\nthe job function.\nAll employers with 15 or more full-time employees, including real estate busi-\nnesses, are covered by ADA effective July 26, 1994. It is the general consensus that\nthe independent contractor status in the real estate industry does not exempt or prevail\nover the intent of the ADA to cover employers.\nTitle I requires reasonable accommodation that does not create an undue hard-\nship on the business involved, provided the essential duties of the job can be per-\nformed by the disabled person, without a direct threat to the safety of the disabled\nperson or others.\nReasonable Accommodation\nReasonable accommodation means modi\ufb01cations or adjustments to a job application\nprocess, to the work environment, or to the circumstances customarily performed,\nand that enable the disabled employee to enjoy equal bene\ufb01ts and privileges of\nemployment.\nA reasonable accommodation involves the alteration of existing facilities and work\nprocedures to make them readily accessible to a disabled employee. This could be\nadjusting a workstation desk height, alternating job requirements, or \ufb02exibility in\nwork hours for the disabled employee. However, the ADA is not intended to lower or\nalter existing required job standards such as police or \ufb01re department quali\ufb01cation.\nPeople who are disabled should be considered for other positions they are quali\ufb01ed\nto perform.\nTitle III-Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities\nby Private Entities\nTitle Ill of the ADA prohibits all private nongovemment entities that own, lease, or op-\nerate a place of public accommodation from discriminating against an individual on the\nbasis of a disability. Accordingly, the ADA requires owners and tenants of public\naccommodations to: (I) remove barriers, and (2) make reasonable modi\ufb01cations.\nThe barrier removal and reasonable modi\ufb01cations are required to ensure equal op-\nportunity for access to individuals with disabilities.\n",

Ferguson, the Supreme Court held that the enforcement of racial seg-\nregation of private or public facilities did not violate the U.S. Constitution as long as\nthe separate facilities were equal.\nThe Supreme Court reversed the separate but equal doctrine in Brown v. Board of\nEducation, outlawing segregation in schools and marking the beginning of the end of the\nera of legalized segregation.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in programs receiving fed-\neral \ufb01nancial assistance. The law had little impact in the housing market.\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, reli-\ngion, and national origin in most types of housing transactions. \"Sex\" was added as a\nprotected class in 1974. The Act also contains a variety of remedies to attack housing\ndiscrimination, including private discrimination.\ngovemmental and private racial discrimination in housing.\nMore he Supreme Cou ho the 1806 i i s A\nd baned\nThe Fair Housing Act was amended in 1972 by a requirement that Equal Housing\nOpportunity posters be displayed in brokerages, mortgage companies, and new home\nsites.\nUnder the Fair Housing Acts of 1968 and 1988 it is unlawful:\n\u2022 To refuse to sell or rent housing to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,\nnational origin, handicap, or familial status\n\u2022 To refuse to negotiate for housing because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,\nhandicap, or familial status\nOther unlawful acts prohibited by the Fair Housing Acts are listed in the body of the\ntext.\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 does not apply to the sale or rental of commercial or\nindustrial properties. There are other exemptions for religious organizations, private\nclubs, owner-occupied buildings with no more than four units, and single-family hous-\ning, under certain circumstances.\nImportant terms to know include blockbusting, steering, and redlining.\nIn 1988, Congress added handicaps and familial status to the list of protected peo-\nple. It is against the 1988 law to refuse to permit a handicapped person, at his or her own\nexpense, to make minor modi\ufb01cations to an existing premise or to refuse to make rea-\nsonable accommodations necessary to afford a person equal opportunity to use and\nenjoy a dwelling.\nThe Fair Housing Act exempts housing for older persons from the familial status\nprovision provided that the area or facility is intended for and solely occupied by per-\nsons 62 years of age or older, or at least one person in 80 percent of the households\nis 55 years or older.

In addition to\nother duties, the Commissioner administers and enforces the Real Estate Code, adopts\nCommissioner's Rules, and investigates written complaints against brokers or salesper-\nsons. The Advisory Board provides the Commissioner with any recommendations it\ndeems necessary and bene\ufb01cial to the best interest of the public.\nA real estate brokerage of\ufb01ce must comply with the following: A brokerage must\nhave a de\ufb01nite, physical location. The designated broker's license must be prominently\ndisplayed. There must be a sign at the entrance that has the broker's name and the bro-\nkerage name. The broker must notify the Commissioner in writing of a change of loca-\ntion. Licensees must have access to a current copy of the Real Estate Department's\nStatutes, Rules, and Annotations.\nChapter 27 \u2022 Arizona Real Estate Code and Commissioner's Rules\nEach branch of\ufb01ce must obtain a branch of\ufb01ce license, must be managed by a\nlicensed broker or salesperson, and must have a sign at the entrance that is the same\nas the main of\ufb01ce's sign, but includes the designation of \"branch of\ufb01ce.\"\nThe Commissioner's Rules related to professional conduct include Duties to Client,\nProperty Negotiations, and Broker Supervision and Control. These rules are lengthy and\ndetailed and should be studied in the body of the text.\nWhen a designated broker is unable to act within 24 hours, a licensee in the employ\nof the broker or another designated broker may be named to act on his or her behalf. The\ndesignation must be made in writing and kept in the broker's of\ufb01ce for 1 year, and must\nnot exceed 30 days' duration. The designation authorizes the designee to perform any\nand all duties the designated broker may legally perform, except that a salesperson\nmay not hire or sever licensees.\nUnless otherwise provided in writing by all parties to a transaction, the broker must\nimmediately deposit funds entrusted to him or her in a neutral escrow account in Ari-\nzona. Funds deposited in the broker's trust account cannot be commingled with the per-\nsonal funds of the broker. The inclusion of up to S500 of the broker's personal funds in\nthe trust account is not considered commingling. The illegal use of funds by the broker\nfor other than their stated purpose is called conversion.\nA broker must keep records of each transaction for 5 years from termination of the\ntransaction. The Commissioner may inspect records and documents at any reasonable\ntime. A summary of document preparation requirements is included in the body of\nt h e text.\nThe designated broker supervises all advertising. A salesperson or broker acting as\nan agent must not advertise property in a manner that implies that no salesperson or bro-\nker is taking part in the offer for sale, lease, or exchange. Such an ad is called a blind ad.\nAny salesperson or broker advertising the salesperson's or broker's own property\nmust disclose the salesperson's or broker's status as a salesperson or broker, and as\nthe property owner in the advertisement.\nAny broker using a trade name owned by another person on signs displayed at the\nplace of business must place the broker's name on the signs.\nIn a court action to collect commission, the complaint must allege that the plain-\ntiff was a quali\ufb01ed licensed broker or salesperson when the claim arose. The court\naction will be dismissed if proof that the broker or salesperson was licensed cannot\nbe provided.\nA licensee must disclose to all parties in a transaction the names of each employing\nbroker who represents a party to the transaction and will receive any portion of the com-\nmission. This does not authorize commission payments to unlicensed persons.\nThere are 25 types of improper conduct listed in the Code that allow the Commis-\nsioner to suspend, revoke, or deny a real estate license, including license renewal. A\nsummary of such improper actions is included in the body of the text.\nA person who acts as a broker or salesperson or who advertises in a manner indi-\ncating that he or she is licensed as a broker or salesperson, without actually being\nlicensed as prescribed by the Code, is guilty of a felony. The penalties do not apply\nin a few instances, which are listed in the text.\nIf it appears to the Commissioner that any person has engaged in any act that con-\nstitutes a violation of the Arizona Real Estate Code, the Commissioner may issue an\norder directing any person to cease and desist, to make restitution, or to take appropriate\naf\ufb01rmative action to correct the conditions resulting from the act.\nA broker must employ and pay active licensees only, and a licensee must accept\nemployment and compensation only from the legally licensed broker to whom the li-\ncensee is licensed.\nBefore the Commissioner can suspend, revoke, or deny the renewal of a real es-\ntate license, the licensee has the opportunity for a hearing. The case is heard and de-\ncided by an administrative law judge. If the Commissioner determines that the public\n389\n",

Speculating is entering into a transaction where the\npro\ufb01ts are subject to chance; to buy or sell with the hope of pro\ufb01ting through the \ufb02uc-\ntuations in price.\nA thorough discussion of investing in real estate is beyond the scope of this text-\nbook. However, any student of real estate should be familiar with some of the basic\n",

Plan-\nning is a common principle for every successful business, but more often than not it is\nignored or overlooked when it comes to real estate. If you really want to succeed with an\ninvestment in real estate, then you will want to:\n1. Learn about the business\n2. Research the market\n3. Develop a plan for success\n4. Acquire an investment according to your plan\n5. Monitor and manage your investment to achieve your goals\nRisk vs. Speculation\nRisk is a major consideration in all real estate investments. Even the purchase of a home\nyou intend to occupy involves some degree of risk. Investment real estate or speculation\nin real estate involves a high degree of risk. As with most investments, buying low and\nselling high is a primary objective. Market conditions, \ufb01nancing, liquidity, staying\npower, and the ability to control the property are all important considerations in evalu-\nating the risk of a real estate investment. Suf\ufb01ce to say that \"rolling the dice\" is not a\nsound approach to real estate investing.\nSpeculating in real estate is much more complicated than merely assuming a higher\ndegree of risk. Speculation is gambling on the \ufb02uctuations in prices. This may seem to\nbe a simple concept in a cyclical market: You buy property when prices are down and\nsell when they go up, but it is de\ufb01nitely not something for the uninitiated. Bad things\nsometimes happen to good investments. As a speculator, you are relying on someone\nor something else to change or happen, the occurrence of which will have, you hope,\na positive effect on your investment. The key word is hope. This is similar to buying\na lottery ticket-you hope your number comes up.\nLeveraging\nLeveraging means borrowing money from another source to supplement your own\nfunds in completing the acquisition of a piece of property. Leverage can dramatically\nincrease your retum on an investment, while spreading some of the risk to others. Le-\nverage can be a mortgage or a limited partnership or just another investor. For example,\nif an investor has $100,000 to invest, he can buy a particular piece of property for\n$100,000, and if he sells the property in 2 years for $125,000, the investor has made\n12.5 percent per annum on his investment, but has had no access to those funds for\n2 years. Utilizing some leverage, the same property can be acquired with an $80,000\nmortgage at say, 8 percent, if he keeps their $80,000 in the bank at 4 percent, then\nthe net interest cost is 4 percent (ignoring any income tax effects) and the return on\nthe $20,000 actually invested is 46.5 percent. Looking at it from a different perspective,\nif you can buy a property for 10 percent down, and market values are increasing at a\n3 percent rate, then your 10 percent investment will cam 30 percent.\nSources of Funding\nThe primary source for leverage funding is real estate lenders. There is an excess of fund-\ning available for real estate investments. Many kinds of \ufb01nancial institutions, mortgage\nbankers, mortgage brokers, sellers, private individuals, and the like are available as sour-\nces of funds for \ufb01nancing real estate investments. Because investing in real estate also\nincludes your personal residence, govemment-backed loans are a great source of lever-\nage. Some FHA or DVA programs will go as high as 95 percent or even 100 percent\non the leverage. A more thorough understanding of real estate lending and \ufb01nancing\nmay be found in Chapters 20 and 21.\nChapter 28 \u2022 Investing in Real Estate and Income Tax Aspects of Real Estate\n395\nShort-Term Bene\ufb01ts\nInvesting in real estate should involve a long-term perspective. There are, however,\nsome short-term bene\ufb01ts that can accrue to the investor, such as cash \ufb02ow and tax\nbene\ufb01ts. Cash \ufb02ow should be determined at the time you evaluate the investment\nopportunity. As part of your due diligence process, you should review the rental in-\ncome schedule and related property expenses so that you can reasonably determine\nthe amount of cash \ufb02ow from the property. Cash \ufb02ow is easily determined as\nf o l l o w s :\nGross income - Operating expenses and loan payments = Net cash \ufb02ow\nIn determining the taxable income from your investment, you will be able to deduct\nall of the operating expenses from the rental income received, as well as take a depre-\nciation deduction (now referred to as cost recovery by the Internal Revenue Service) for\na pro-rata amount of the cost of the buildings and improvements. This is usually a sig-\nni\ufb01cant tax bene\ufb01t, very often turning a taxable income into a tax loss. These tax losses\ncan be used to offset other sources of income in an individual's tax return, thereby pro-\nviding another tax bene\ufb01t.\nIn the meantime, the rents you have received have been used to pay the mortgage,\nwhich increases your equity. Your property's market value should be appreciating, so\nthat when it is time to sell the property, you will realize a signi\ufb01cant pro\ufb01t. This pro\ufb01t\nor gain will be taxable; however, it will be taxed as a capital gain, where currently the\nmaximum rate is 15 percent.\nINCOME TAX AND REAL ESTATE\nAs the cost of govemment climbs, the federal income tax remains a major personal ob-\nligation. Included in the income tax laws are certain opportunities for individuals to re-\nduce or defer their income tax obligations. The federal income tax code, rules, and\nregulations are complicated and constantly changing. Therefore, real estate agents and\nbrokers should not provide tax advice to their clients and customers, but should refer\nthem to a professional tax accountant or attomey.\nHowever, real estate agents should have a basic understanding of tax laws in order\nto alert clients and customers to the potential tax risks or savings opportunities and to\nknow when to recommend that they seek professional advice. In order to appreciate\nthe income tax bene\ufb01ts related to the ownership of real estate, the agent must understand\nthe basic concepts and tax rates for individual income taxes.\nBasic Concepts\nTaxable income for the individual taxpayer is computed as follows:\nGross Income\nL e s s\nDeductions for Adjusted Grass Income\nEquals\nAdjusted Gross Income\nLess\nItemized Deductions or Standard \nDeduction and Personal Exemptions\nEquals\nTaxable Income\n",

Generally, everything an individual receives as payment for\npersonal services must be included in gross income.\n\u2022 Portfolio income is income that is a retum on invested capital, such as interest\nand dividends.\n\u2022 Passive income is income from a business in which the owner does not materially\nparticipate. Rental real estate is generally classi\ufb01ed as a passive activity.\n\u2022 A capital gain or loss is a gain or loss on the sale of a capital asset. As a general rule,\neverything a taxpayer owns for personal and investment purposes is a capital asset.\nAdjusted Gross Income\nTo determine adjusted gross income, a taxpayer subtracts amounts speci\ufb01cally author-\nized by the Revenue Code from gross income. Among the items currently authorized for\ndeduction are: IRA, SEP, Simple, and quali\ufb01ed plan contributions; health savings ac-\ncount contributions; employment-related moving expenses; self-employed health insur-\nance deduction; one-half of self-employment tax; student loan interest deduction;\nalimony paid; and tuition and fees deduction.\nCurrently, a taxpayer's adjusted gross income affects the extent to which he or she\ncan withhold itemized deductions for medical expenses, casualty and theft losses, char-\nitable contributions, and other miscellaneous items. These particular deductions are\nlimited to amounts in excess of speci\ufb01c percentages of an individual's adjusted\ngross income.\nItemized Deductions\nItemized deductions may include personal expenses for the following:\n1. Medical and dental\n2. Taxes\n3. Interest\n4. Gifts to charity\n5. Casualty and theft losses\n6. Job expenses and other miscellancous deductions\nAlthough a thorough discussion of itemized deductions is beyond the scope of this text-\nbook, keep in mind that many rules and regulations limit the amount of the above per-\nsonal expenses that may be included in the itemized deduction.\nTaxpayers are entitled to a standard deduction amount. The amount of the deduction\nvaries according to the \ufb01ling status of the taxpayer and is adjusted annually by a cost-of-\nliving adjustment. If the total of a taxpayer's itemized deductions exceeds the amount of\nthe standard deduction, then he or she may use the higher amount. The deduction is then\nsubtracted from the \ufb01gure for adjusted gross income.\nPersonal and dependent exemptions are also subtracted from adjusted gross income\nto determine taxable income. The amount of these exemptions is adjusted annually 1o\nre\ufb02ect increases in the cost of living. Currently, deductions for personal exemptions\nare reduced or eliminated for taxpayers at higher income levels. For 2006, the personal\nexemption was $3,300, but was phased out when adjusted gross income exceeded\n$150,500 for single persons and S225,750 for married persons \ufb01ling a joint return.\nChapter 28 \u2022 Investing in Real Estate and Income Tax Aspects of Real Estate\n397\nTax Rates\nIn 2006, there were six basic individual tax rates of 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent,\n28 percent, 3 percent, and 35 percent. The 35 percent rate applies to taxable income in\nexcess of S336,550.\nThere are now eight different rates used to calculate a corporation's federal income\ntax. These rates range from 15 percent for taxable incomes under $50,000 to 39 percent\nfor income between $100,000 and S335,000. For larger pro\ufb01table corporations, the rates\nblend to produce an effective rate of 34 percent if the corporation makes up to\n$10,000,000, or 35 percent if it makes $18,333,333 or more.\nThe difference between corporate and individual tax rates in\ufb02uences the selection\nof the entity to hold a real estate investment. There are many entities available\nindividual, corporation, partnership, limited partnership, and so on. This choice can sig-\nni\ufb01cantly affect the investor's retum on the investment, and therefore, often requires the\nassistance of legal and accounting professionals. A discussion of the income tax aspects\nrelated to the selection of an entity for holding a real estate investment is included in\nChapter 11.\nThe marginal rate is the rate of tax on the next dollar of income, whereas the\neffective rate is the average tax rate on all of the individual's taxable income. For ex-\nample, if a married taxpayer \ufb01ling jointly had taxable income of $320,000 before\nreceiving additional income of S10,000, the marginal rate on the additional income\nwould be 33 percent, meaning that S0.33 of the next $1.00 of the couple's income\nrepresents taxes they must pay, whereas the effective rate (average rate) of the cou-\nples' income would be 27 percent. The marginal tax rate is used to determine the ben-\ne\ufb01t o f tax-deductible expenses.\nRENTAL REAL ESTATE\nAccounting for the income and expenses of a rental property may be done on a cash\nbasis or an accrual basis. As a taxpayer you must elect one method or the other, how-\never, almost all individual taxpayers use the cash basis. On the cash basis, rental income\nis reported in the year in which payment is received, and expenses are reported in the\nyear they are actually paid. On the accrual basis, rental income is reported in the year\nin which the taxpayer is entitled to receive payment, less an allowance for uncollectible\nrentals, and expenses are accrued when they are due rather than when paid.\nAdvance Rentals vs. Security Deposits\nA taxpayer should always distinguish between advance rentals and security deposits.\nAdvance rentals are income when received. They are reported in the year received,\nwhether the taxpayer is reporting on a cash or accrual basis. Security deposits are\ndeposited with the landlord solely as security for the tenant's performance of the\nterms of the lease, and are usually not taxed when received. If the tenant breaches the\nlease, the landlord is entitled to apply the sum as rent, at which time the deposit is\nreported as income. If the landlord and the tenant both agree that a security deposit is\nto be used as a \ufb01nal rent payment, it is advance rent and included as rental income\nwhen received.\nImprovements by a Tenant\nA landlord does not realize taxable income when a tenant improves the leased premises,\nprovided the improvements are not a substitute for rent payments. Furthermore, when\nthe landlord takes possession of the improvements at lease termination, income is not\nrealized. However, because the landlord has no tax basis in the improvements, they\nmay not be depreciated.\n",

For cash basis taxpayers, normal operating expenses\nare deductible in the year the expenses are paid. Examples of nonnal operating expenses\ninclude:\n\u2022 Utilities\n\u2022 Interest on mortgages and loans\n\u2022 Insurance\n\u2022 Property and sales taxes\n\u2022 Gardening and cleaning expenses\n\u2022 License and city fees\n\u2022 Repairs and maintenance\n\u2022 Management fees\n\u2022 Advertising and rental commissions\nInterest\nInterest on mortgages and other debt speci\ufb01cally related to the rental property is deduct-\nible as an operating expense. Of course, any portion of these loan payments that is a\nprincipal reduction may not be included as an operating expense.\nRepair vs. Capital Improvement\nTaxpayers frequently have dif\ufb01culty distinguishing between a repair and a capital im-\nprovement. It is important to differentiate between the two, because maintenance and\nrepair expenses are not treated in the same way as costs for capital improvements and\nreplacements. Only maintenance and incidental repair costs are deductible against rental\nincome. Improvements that add value, prolong the life of the property, or adapt it to new\nuses are capital improvements. Capital improvements may not be deducted currently, but\nmay be depreciated.\nA repair keeps the real property in good operating condition. For example, repairs\ninclude painting, \ufb01xing gutters or \ufb02oors, \ufb01xing leaks in plumbing or roof, plastering,\nand replacing broken windows.\nCapital improvements include carpeting, window coverings, new roof, new\nplumbing or electrical systems, building additions, and major repairs such as a new\ndriveway, refurbishing stucco, or new landscaping.\nDEPRECIATION\nThe principal tax advantage for owners of investment real property is depreciation. The\nproperty must be a \"capital asset\" under Sec. 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code, which\nmeans a capital asset used in a trade or business. Therefore, you may not depreciate your\npersonal residence. The depreciation deduction often alows net positive cash \ufb02ow to be\nenjoyed by the taxpayer without any current tax liability.\nDepreciation is the annual deduction alowed for recovering the taxpayer's cost of\nthe investment property. The depreciation deduction is allowable on the portion of the\ncost allocated to the buildings and improvements as these are subject to wear and\ntear, decay, and obsolescence. The cost of land is not depreciable.\nFor real property acquired after May 1993, taxpayers must use the Modi\ufb01ed Accel-\nerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). Assets are classi\ufb01ed based on their stipulated\nrecovery period. The recovery period for residential rental property placed in service\nafter December 31, 1986, is 27.5 years. The recovery period for nonresidential rental\nChapter 28 \u2022 Investing in Real Estate and Income Tax Aspects of Real Estate\nproperty is 39 years for property placed in service after May 12, 1993. The recovery pe-\nriod is 31.5 years for nonresidential property placed in service after December 31, 1986,\nbut before May 13, 1993. Real estate acquired prior to January 1, 1987, is subject to\ndifferent recovery periods. Because this is a very complex area of the tax code, it is a\ngood idea to review the proper asset classi\ufb01cations and recovery periods with your pro-\nfessional tax advisor when planning your investment strategy.\nResidential and Nonresidential Rental Property\nResidential rental property is a building or structure in which 80 percent or more of\nthe gross rental income is rental income from dwelling units. A dwelling unit is a\nhouse or apartment used to provide living accommodations. A dwelling unit does not\ninclude hotel units, motel units, and other establishments where more than half the\nunits are used on a transient basis.\nNonresidential property is simply real property that is not residential rental\nproperty.\nDepreciation Deduction Computation\nThe computation of the depreciation deduction for real property uses the mid-month\nconvention, which requires that the depreciation for the \ufb01rst year a property is placed\nin service will be based on the number of months the property was in service. For prop-\nerty placed in service during a month it will be treated as placed in service in the middle\nof the month.\nAn example of the depreciation calculation for a nonresidential building placed in\nservice in June 2007 is as follows:\nTotal Cost\nLess Land Cost\nBuilding Cost\n51,000,000\n(200.000)\n800.000\nThe recovery period is 39 years and the annual depreciation is $20,513 (S800,000\ndivided by 39). Depreciation in the year 2007 would be for 6 1/2 months or S11,111\naccording to the mid-month convention.\nPASSIVE LOSS LIMITATION\nPassive activities generally include any business or investment activity in which the tax-\npayer does not materially participate. The rental of real or personal property is generally\na rental activity under the passive activity loss rules, but exceptions apply. The passive\nactivity laws were intended to discourage tax-shelter investments, but their reach goes\nbeyond tax shelters to cover all real estate investors and persons who invest in busi-\nnesses as silent partners, or who are not involved full time in the business.\nThe passive activity rules prevent an investor from deducting what the law de\ufb01nes\nas a passive loss from eamed income such as salary, self-employment income, or port-\nfolio income such as interest, dividends, or retirement income. Such losses are deduct-\nible only from income from other passive activities.\nReal Estate Professionals\nRental income and losses are automatically treated as passive unless eared or incurred\nby a real estate professional, or the rentals are considered by law to be business activity.\nEven if rental income or loss is eared by a professional or is considered business in-\ncome, the passive loss restrictions still apply unless the taxpayer materially participates\ni n the activity.\n399\n",

Therefore, if all the requirements are met, a real\nestate professional could reduce camed income, such as commissions, by the amount\nof any losses from rental real estate. There are two tests that must be met in order to\nbe classi\ufb01ed as a real estate professional. First, more than half of the personal services\nyou perform in trades or businesses were performed in real property trades or businesses\nin which you materially participated; and second, you performed more than 750 hours of\nservices in real property trades or businesses in which you materially participated.\nMaterial participation generally applies only to trades or businesses in which you\nhave an ownership interest greater than 5 percent. In addition, there are seven tests under\nwhich a taxpayer can then qualify to meet the material participation requirement. These\ntests typically deal with the number of hours of participation accumulated during the\nyear in a particular activity. The taxpayer needs to meet only one of the seven tests to\nqualify as a material participant. If the taxpayer meets one of the tests, the taxpayer is\nconsidered to have materially participated in that activity, and the income and loss\nfrom the business activity is considered non-passive for that year.\nRental Real Estate Passive Loss Allowance\nThe owner of rental real estate may deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the rental real\nestate against non-passive income, such as salaries and wages, if the owner actively par-\nticipates in the management of the rental real estate, and is not a real estate professional.\nActive participation is a lower level of involvement than material participation.\nThe owner can have an agent manage his or her property and still meet the active par-\nticipation test. The taxpayer must show that he or she participates in management deci-\nsions, such as selecting tenants, setting rental terms, and reviewing expenses. The IRS\nmay not recognize the taxpayer's activity as meeting the test if the activity is only af\ufb01r-\nmation of the manager's decisions. The taxpayer must have at least a 10 percent interest\nin the rental real estate to qualify for the loss allowance. Limited partners are not con-\nsidered active participants and do not qualify for the allowance.\nComputing the Allowance\nThe $25,000 allowance is computed as follows: First, match income and loss from all of\nthe rental real estate activities in which the active participation test is met. A net loss from\nthese activities is then applied to net passive income, if any, from other sources to deter-\nmine the amount of the rental real estate loss that can reduce other non-passive income.\nExample: Rob Rental has an $80,000 salary, $10,000 income from a limited partnership\n(passive income), and $30,000 loss from rental real estate in which he actively participated.\nThe $30,000 loss is \ufb01rst reduced by the $10,000 limited partnership income. The $20,000\nremaining balance of the rental real estate loss is deductible from the salary income due\nto the rental real estate allowance,\nThe Rental Real Estate Loss Allowance is phased out when the taxpayer has modi-\n\ufb01ed adjusted gross income over $100,000. For every dollar of income over $100,000,\nthe loss allowance is reduced by 50 cents. When the modi\ufb01ed adjusted gross income\nreaches $150,000, the allowance is completely phased out.\nA taxpayer's other sources of income in a particular tax year determine which clas-\nsi\ufb01cation (passive or non-passive) is more advantageous,\nExample: 1f Tom had income from an apartment complex of $50,000, it would automatically\nbe considered passive and could be reduced only by passive losses. Therefore, if Tom was\nalso an owner in a business entity with an allocated operating loss of S30,000, it could\nonly be used to reduce the apartment complex operating pro\ufb01t in Tom's tax relum if it\nwas classi\ufb01ed as a passive loss, which requires that Tom not materially participate in the\nactivities of the business entity.\nChapter 28 \u2022 Investing in Real Estate and Income Tax Aspects of Real Estate\nThe major factor in determining the characterization of the income from business\nentities is whether the taxpayer materially participates. As previously stated, material\nparticipation must be determined on an annual basis. The taxpayer must be able to\nprove the level of participation by keeping an appointment book, calendar, or log of\nthe days and time spent in the operation. The IRS will not recognize time spent as an\ninvestor as participation unless the taxpayer can show involvement in daily operations\nor management of the activity.\n401\nINCOME TAX AND THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY\nCapital Gains and Losses\nInvesting in real estate provides a signi\ufb01cant tax break, because frequently the sale of\nreal property at a gain is taxed at capital gain rates. A capital gain or loss results\nfrom the sale of a capital asset, which generally includes all assets owned as an invest-\nment or for personal purposes. Examples include stocks, bonds, a personal residence,\nhousehold furnishings, cars, precious metals, and assets used in a trade or business.\nHowever, the capital gain tax rate is not available for all property sales, because the cap-\nital gains rate availability depends on the taxpayer's purpose for holding the property.\nFor example, business inventory and property held for sale to customers is not consid-\nered a capital asset.\nA capital gain occurs when the sale price of a capital asset exceeds the adjusted\ncost basis of the asset sold. When capital assets are sold at a gain, the applicable tax\nrate depends on the period of time the taxpayer held the property before sale. The favor-\nable capital gains tax rate applies only to long-term capital gains, which require a\nholding period of more than 1 year. The maximum tax rate applicable to long-term cap-\nital gains is 15 percent whereas the rate applicable to ordinary income was as high as\n35 percent in 2006. The 20 percent rate difference enhances investment returns when\nthe investment strategy emphasizes capital appreciation over current income.\nComputing Capital Gains and Losses\nCapital gains or losses are computed as follows:\n1. Amount Realized or Total Selling Price\n2. Cost or Other Unadjusted Basis\n3. Plus: Improvements\n4. Minus: Accumulated Depreciation\n5. Adjusted Basis (2 plus 3 minus 4)\n6. Selling Expenses\n7. Total Cost (5 plus 6)\n8. Gain or Loss (subtract 7 from 1)\nS\nAmount Realized\nThe amount realized is the total selling price. It includes cash, the fair market value of\nadditional property received, and any liabilities that the buyer agrees to pay. A buyer's\nnote (purchase money mortgage) is included in the selling price at fair market value.\nThis is generally the discounted amount that a bank or other party will pay for the note.\nThe selling price includes the amount of the unpaid mortgage.

The full amount of\nthe unpaid mortgage is included, even if the value of the property is less than the\nunpaid mortgage.\nUnadjusted Basis\nThe cost or unadjusted basis is the original cost of the property, if it was purchased.\nThere are different rules for determining unadjusted basis when the property was\nreceived by gift, inheritance, or tax-deferred exchange. For property purchased, the\nunadjusted basis is the cash paid plus the value of any property given to the seller. If\na mortgage is assumed or the property is bought subject to a mortgage, the amount of\nthe mortgage is part of the unadjusted basis. Purchase expenses are also included,\nsuch as real estate commissions, title insurance recording fees, escrow fees, and survey\ncosts. When a buyer pays part of the purchase price by providing services, the value of\nthe services is included in the unadjusted basis to the extent of the taxable compensation.\nPermanent improvements and additions made to the property are also added to the\nunadjusted basis. Examples include adding a room or a fence, putting in new plumbing\nor wiring, and paving a driveway. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are not considered\nimprovements and do not increase the cost basis, but if the property is rental real estate,\nthey would be deducted as operating expenses. The cost of repairing real estate after a\ncasualty such as a \ufb01re or storm would also be added to the cost basis. However, the unin-\nsured loss from the casualty and any insurance awards will reduce the cost basis.\nThe unadjusted basis is reduced for the amount of depreciation that was allowed or\nallowable during the ownership period. Selling expenses are added to the adjusted basis\nto determine the net cost that is deducted from the selling price to arrive at the capital\ngain or loss. Examples of selling expenses are real estate commissions, escrow fees, title\ninsurance, and recording fees.\nTo obtain the bene\ufb01t of the 15 percent capital gains rate, the taxpayer must hold the\ncapital asset more than 1 year before selling. When the asset is held for more than 1 year\nthe gain or loss on the sale is classi\ufb01ed as long-term.\nINCOME TAX ADVANTAGES OF HOME OWNERSHIP\nHome ownership is the comerstone of the American dream. Historically, a home has\nbeen a taxpayer's most valuable asset, both \ufb01nancially and emotionally. The tax law\ngives home ownership numerous tax bene\ufb01ts, including the home mortgage interest de-\nduction and the personal residence gain exclusion.\nHome Mortgage Interest Deduction\nA taxpayer can generally deduct interest expense as an itemized deduction. The interest\nmust be paid during the tax year on the types of debt related to the acquisition of a residence\nor a home-equity loan, as long as the debt is secured by a quali\ufb01ed residence. A quali\ufb01ed\nresidence is a taxpayer's principal residence or one other home. Interest expenses related to\nother personal debts, such as the purchase of a car, are not deductible.\nA taxpayer can deduct interest on debt that is incurred in acquiring, constructing,\nsubstantially improving, or re\ufb01nancing a quali\ufb01ed residence. This type of debt is referred\nto as acquisition indebtedness. Acquisition indebtedness is limited to $1,000,000 and can\nbe incurred in the purchase of a maximum of two residences. Therefore, if the taxpayer\nhas a principal residence and two other residences, such as a beach house and a mountain\ncabin, only the debt related to the principal residence and one of the other two residences\ncan qualify as home acquisition indebtedness. For the interest to be deductible as home\nacquisition interest, the debt must be secured by the real property acquired.\nChapter 28 \u2022 Investing in Real Estate and Income Tax Aspects of Real Estate\n403\nHome Equity Loans\nInterest paid is also deductible on up to $100,000 of home equity loans. For the interest\nto be deductible, the home equity loan cannot exceed the fair market value of the resi-\ndence, reduced by any acquisition indebtedness. The purpose of the funds related to the\nhome equity loan is usually not relevant when determining whether interest paid on it is\ndeductible. For example, the fact that the proceeds from a home equity loan are used to\n\ufb01nance the purchase of a new car does not affect interest deductibility. However, if the\ndebt proceeds are used to purchase tax-exempt municipal bonds, the interest expense\nwould not be deductible.\nPoints\nPoints paid in arranging \ufb01nancing are generally treated as prepaid interest that must be\ndeducted over the period of the loan. However, there is an exception for points paid on a\nloan to buy, build, or improve the principal residence. The points on such loans are de-\nductible in the year paid if these tests are met:\n1. The loan is secured by the principal residence.\n2. Charging points is an established business practice in the geographic area where\nthe loan is made.\n3. The points charged do not exceed the points generally charged in the area.\n4. The amount of points is computed as a percentage of the loan and speci\ufb01cally labeled\non the closing statement as \"points,\" \"loan origination fees,\" or \"loan discount.\"\n5. The points are paid directly to the lender\nPoints withheld from the principal of a loan used to buy a principal residence are treated as\nif they were paid directly to the lender, as long as the taxpayer has made a down payment,\nescrow deposit, or carest money deposit at or before closing. The down payment, escrow\ndeposit, or earnest money deposit must be at least equal to the amount of the points with-\nheld. If the loan is used to improve the principal residence, the points are not immediately\ndeductible if withheld from the loan principal. In order to claim the full deduction in the\nyear of payment, the taxpayer must pay the points with funds that have not been obtained\nfrom the lender. Otherwise, the deduction must be spread over the loan term.\nPoints paid by a seller are deductible by the buyer in the year of acquisition. The\nseller's payment is treated as an adjustment to the purchase price that the seller gives\nto the buyer and tumed over to the lender to pay the points. The buyer must reduce\nthe cost basis of the home for the points paid by the seller.\nThe IRS does not allow a current deduction for points on a re\ufb01nancing of debt\nsecured by a quali\ufb01ed residence. The points must be deducted ratably over the loan pe-\nriod, unless part of the new loan is used for home improvements. For example, if a tax-\npayer paid points of $3,600 when re\ufb01nancing a 30-year mortgage on the principal\nresidence, a deduction of only S120 per year would be allowed.\nAlso, if points are paid for a mortgage debt secured by a second home or a vacation\nhome, the points can be deducted over the life of the loan only. When a taxpayer is\ndeducting points over the term of the loan because a full \ufb01rst-year deduction is not\nallowed, the taxpayer may deduct the unamortized balance in the year the mortgage\nends (such as when the loan is re\ufb01nanced).\nPersonal Residence Gain Exclusion\nOne of the major tax bene\ufb01ts of home ownership is the gain exclusion available on the\nsale of a principal residence. A taxpayer can exclude up to $250,000 of gain from the\nsale of the taxpayer's home as long as the property is owned and used as the principal\nresidence by the taxpayer for at least 2 of the 5 years before sale. Married taxpayers \ufb01l-\ning jointly may exclude a gain up to $500,000.\n",

If the taxpayer meets the\nownership-and-use test for a principal residence, he or she can claim the exclusion\neven if the exclusion was previously claimed for a different residence, provided that\nthe sales are more than 2 years apart.\nIf a taxpayer claims the exclusion on a sale and within 2 years of the \ufb01rst sale sells\nanother principal residence, the exclusion may not be claimed on the second sale, even if\nthe taxpayer met the ownership-and-use tests for that residence. There is an exception if\nthe second sale was due to a change in employment, health reasons, or unforescen cir-\ncumstances. In those cases, a prorated exclusion is allowed.\nPrincipal Residence\nA principal residence is not restricted to single-family homes, but may include a house,\nmobile home, houseboat, co-op, or condominium apartment used as the taxpayer's main\nhome. An investment in a retirement community does not qualify as a principal resi-\ndence, unless the taxpayer receives equity in the property. Your main home is the one\nyou live in most of the time.\nSpouses\nIf a married couple has owned and lived in their principal residence for at least 2 years\nduring the S-year period ending on the date of sale, they may claim an exclusion of up to\nS500,000 of the gain on a joint return. The up-to-S500,000 exclusion may be claimed on\na joint retum provided that during the 5-year period ending on the date of sale:\n1. Either spouse owned the residence for at least 2 years.\n2. Both spouses lived in the house as their principal residence for at least 2 years.\n3. Neither spouse claimed the exclusion on a sale of a principal residence within the\n2-year period ending on the date of the sale.\nIf tests one and three are met, but only one spouse meets test two, the exclusion limit on\na joint retum is $250,000.\nHot Markets\nSellers of a principal residence in hot, upscale real estate markets will have to pay capital\ngains tax on any pro\ufb01t above the $250,000/S500,000 limits. Because the exclusion is\navailable once every 2 years, whether or not it has been used before, some homeowners\nmay decide to sell before their gains exceed the limits. That way, additional gain on their\nreplacement residence could also qualify for the exclusion in another 2 years.\nTAX-DEFERRED EXCHANGE OF PROPERTY\nA tax-deferred exchange is a transaction in which \"like-kind\" property is traded. Like-\nkind means exchanging business or income property for other business or income prop-\nerty, or exchanging personal property for personal property. A strong motivation for\nexchanging property is the ability to defer capital gains income tax on the transaction.\nSection 1031\nSection 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code states that no gain or loss will be recognized\nif property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is exchanged\nfor property of like kind to be held for similar purposes. Payment of any capital gains tax\nis deferred until the time the replacement property is sold\nUnlike property can be included in an exchange in order to balance the equity in the\ntrade. However, a capital gains tax will be due from the recipient of the unlike property.\nUnlike property received in a tax-deferred exchange is called boot.\nChapter 28 \u2022 Investing in Real Estate and Income Tax Aspects of Real Estate\n405\nStarker Case\nThe 1979 Supreme Court decision on the Starker Case has had a lasting effect on tax-\ndeferred exchanges. Before this decision, it was thought that the exchange of properties\nhad to take place all at once in order to qualify as tax-deferred. The key outcome of this\ncase was that simultaneous conveyance is not a requirement for a tax-free exchange. The\nessential facts of the Starker case are as follows:\nOn April 1, 1967. TJ. Starker and his son and daughter-in-law entered into an exchange\nagreement with the Crown Zellerbach Corporation by which the Starkers agreed to convey\ntimberland to Crown that was valued by the parties at S1,500,000. In return, Crown agreed to\ntransfer property of equal value to the Starkers over a S-year period. The Starkers deeded\ntheir timberland to Crown and during the next 2\u00bd years, the Starkers designated suf\ufb01cient\npropertics of equal value to conclude the transaction\nFor their 1967 income tax returs, all three Starkers reported the transaction as a tax-\ndeferred exchange. The Internal Revenue Service disagreed and required the Starkers to\npay income taxes as if the transaction was an outright sale. The Starkers paid the taxes\nand \ufb01led for refunds in the U.S. District Court.\nThe Starkers won their case, but the IRS declared they would not abide by the\ncourt's decision. Several years later, the IRS de\ufb01ned what would be allowable. The\nrule is either that the properties in the exchange must either have simultaneous closings,\nor \"the property to be traded for must be identi\ufb01ed within 45 days of the closing of the\n\ufb01rst property, proceeds held in trust, and the identi\ufb01ed property must be closed within\n6 months.\" This includes the 45-day identity period.\nIRS Rules for 1031 Tax-Deferred Exchanges\n\u2022 There must be an exchange between parties.\n\u2022 Must be like-kind: Farms, ranches, stores, of\ufb01ces, warehouses, hotels, motels,\nshopping centers, industrial, apartments, bare land, and rental houses are all like-kind.\nLike-kind property is \"any . . . property held for productive use in a trade or\nbusiness for investment.\"\n\u2022 Cannot be non-like-kind: Non-like-kind property includes real estate contracts (install-\nment sales), personal residence, vacation homes, personal property, stock-in-trade\n(developer property), stocks, bonds, and interest in partnership. These items cannot be\nexchanged. Personal residences and vacation homes can be converted to investments.\n\u2022 Time requirements: Target properties must be identi\ufb01ed within 45 days; the \"clock\"\nstarts the day the \ufb01rst escrow closes. It is not necessary to have camest money on\nthe target property. The exchange period ends 180 days after the \"clock\" starts\n(including the 45-day identi\ufb01cation period). There are no exceptions, no extensions,\nand Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays count. An exchangor must have a quali\ufb01ed\nintermediary and the exchange documents must be in place before the \ufb01rst escrow\ncloses. A quali\ufb01ed intermediary acts as an exchange facilitator.\n\u2022 Identi\ufb01cation rules: The identi\ufb01cation criteria must be written, signed, and delivered\nto the quali\ufb01ed intermediary. The exchangor must abide by either the three-\nproperty rule or the 200 percent rule. The three-property rule says that the\nexchangor can identify three properties of any value. The 200 percent rule says that\nthe exchangor can identify any number of properties, as long as the combined\nfair market value does not exceed 200 percent of the relinquished property.\n\u2022 Related parties: There is a 2-year holding period on exchanges between related\nparties. Related parties includes certain blood relatives, most corporation or part-\nnership interests, and most agents of the exchangor.\n\u2022 Actual or constructive receipt of funds: Funds must be in \"substantially limited\naccess.\" The exchangor or his or her agent cannot receive exchange funds. Certain\nrestrictions apply as to how and when funds are to be used or released to the exchangor.\n",

This is a very popular type of\nexchange, which is often used in order to retain some cash.\n\u2022 Future construction: A \"build to suit\" exchange can apply to new construction or\nremodels. The 45-day/180-day time limit applies, however, so the project must be\ncompleted within the 6-month timeframe. A quali\ufb01ed intermediary will hold title to\nthe property until the construction is complete.\n\u2022 Other rules cover interest or growth factor, direct deeding, \ufb01nancing, residential\nconversions, multiple owners, partnerships, and reverse exchanges\n1031 Tenant-in-Common Investment\nIt is important to remember that timing is critical; the IRS strictly interprets the 4S-day\nand 180-day rules, and identifying a replacement property may be dif\ufb01cult. The fair mar-\nket value and equity of the replacement property must be equal to or greater than the\nproperty being sold in order to avoid receiving any boot. If a speci\ufb01c property cannot\nbe located quickly, the exchangor may want to consider a tenant-in-common (TIC)\ninvestment. Essentially, this is buying an undivided interest in a development or other\ncommercial property with other investors who are also tenants-in-common.\nThe IRS has guidelines and speci\ufb01c criteria that must be followed by the spon-\nsors of these investments, but they do provide a source of qualifying like-kind rental\nreal estate investments for 1031 tax-deferred exchanges. They will be marketed and\nsold through registered securities broker dealers. The important distinction here is\nthat these investments are not partnership interests. Partnership interests are personal\nproperty and do not qualify for 1031 tax-deferred exchanges. These are sophisticated\ninvestments that are available and can be very bene\ufb01cial to someone looking for a\nreplacement property. However, exchangors are well advised to get their accountants\nand lawyers involved at an early stage because 45 days is not really a great deal\no f time.\nCHAPTER SUMMARY\nInvesting is committing capital to a business in order to eam a \ufb01nancial retum or pro\ufb01t.\nSpeculating is entering into a transaction where the pro\ufb01ts are subject to chance. Risk is\na major consideration in all real estate investments, Investment real estate or speculation\nin real estate involves a high degree of risk. Leveraging means borrowing money from\nanother source to supplement your own funds in completing the acquisition of a piece of\nproperty. The primary source for leverage funding is real estate lenders.\nTaxable income for an individual taxpayer is computed as follows: gross income -\ndeductions for adjusted gross income = adjusted gross income - itemized deductions or\nstandard deduction and personal exemptions = taxable income.\nGross income includes cared income, portfolio income, passive income, and capital\ngains and losses. To determine adjusted gross income, a taxpayer subtracts amounts specif-\nically authorized by the Revenue Code from gross income. Currently, a taxpayer's adjusted\ngross income affects the extent to which he or she can withhold itemized deductions.\nAccounting for the income and expenses of a rental property may be done on a cash\nbasis or an accrual basis. Taxpayers must elect one method or the other. Almost all in-\ndividual taxpayers use the cash basis.\nA taxpayer should always distinguish between advance rentals and security depos-\nits. Advance rentals are income when received. They are reported in the year received,\nChapter 28 \u2022 Investing in Real Estate and Income Tax Aspects of Real Estate\nwhether the taxpayer is reporting on a cash or accrual basis. Security deposits are depos-\nited with the landlord solely as security for the tenant's performance of the terms of the\nlease, and are usually not taxed when received. A landlord does not realize taxable in-\ncome when a tenant improves the leased premises.\nAll expenses incurred by the real property owner in the operation of the property are\ndeductible from the rental income. Interest on mortgages and other debt speci\ufb01cally re-\nlated to the rental property is deductible as an operating expense.\nA repair keeps the real property in good operating condition. Capital improvements\ninclude carpeting, window coverings, new roof, new plumbing or electrical systems, and\nmajor repairs. Only maintenance and incidental repair costs are deductible against rental\nincome\nThe principal tax advantage for owners of investment real property is depreciation.\nDepreciation is the annual deduction allowed for recovering the depreciable cost of the\ninvestment property. The property must be a capital asset used in a trade or business. A\npersonal residence may not be depreciated.\nResidential rental property is a building or structure in which 80 percent or more of\nthe gross rental income is rental income from dwelling units. Nonresidential property is\nsimply real property that is not residential rental property.\nPassive activities generally include any business or investment activity in which the\ntaxpayer does not materially participate. The rental of real or personal property is gen-\nerally a rental activity under the passive activity loss rules, but exceptions apply. The\npassive activity rules prevent an investor from deducting what the law de\ufb01nes as a pas-\nsive loss from eared income or portfolio income. Such losses are deductible only from\nincome from other passive activities.\nRental income and losses are automatically treated as passive unless earned or\nincurred by a real estate professional, or the rentals are considered by law to be busi-\nness activity. Even if rental income or loss is camed by a professional or is considered\nbusiness income, the passive loss restrictions still apply unless the taxpayer materially\nparticipates in the activity.\nThe owner of rental real estate may deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the rental real\nestate against non-passive income, if the owner actively participates in the management\nof the rental real estate, and is not a real estate professional.\nInvesting in real estate provides a signi\ufb01cant tax break, because frequently the sale\nof real property at a gain is taxed at capital gain rates. A capital gain or loss results from\nthe sale of a capital asset, which generally includes all assets owned as an investment or\nfor personal purposes. A capital gain occurs when the sale price of a capital asset\nexceeds the adjusted cost basis of the asset sold. When capital assets are sold at a\ngain, the applicable tax rate depends on the period of time the taxpayer held the property\nbefore sale. The favorable capital gains tax rate applies only to long-term capital gains.\nwhich require a holding period of more than 1 year.\nThe amount realized is the total selling price. The cost or unadjusted basis is the\noriginal cost of the property, if it was purchased. There are different rules for determin-\ning unadjusted basis when the property was received by gift, inheritance, or tax-deferred\nThe tax law gives home ownership numerous tax bene\ufb01ts, including the home mort-\ngage interest deduction and the personal residence gain exclusion.\nThe home mortgage interest deduction allows a taxpayer to deduct interest expense\nas an itemized deduction. The interest must be paid during the tax year on the types of\ndebt related to the acquisition of a residence or a home-equity loan, as long as the debt is\nsecured by a quali\ufb01ed residence. A quali\ufb01ed residence is a taxpayer's principal resi-\ndence or one other home.\nA taxpayer can deduct interest on debt that is incurred in acquiring, constructing,\nsubstantially improving, or re\ufb01nancing a quali\ufb01ed residence. This type of debt is re-\nferred to as acquisition indebtedness.\n407\n",
